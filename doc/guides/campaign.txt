Javelin is a complex game with simple rules. You can learn everything just by playing so go ahead and try! Don't be upset if something unexpected happens or you die, since it can be a difficult game, especially on the early levels and when you're just starting. This guide leaves a lot unexplained on purpose. 

You control one or more squads and explore the world at large. Towns have shops, let you rest to recover health and also upgrade your units when they have enough experience points (XP). You can manage how towns grow (labor projects) or let the game do that for you.

Towns will post quests, which you can see on the town screen. After a quest is done, come back to claim your reward. Completing or failing quests will raise or lower happiness accordingly - which in turn translates to a small bonus or penalty to how fast work gets done.

Towns can slowly improve your reputation, especially if they're happy and have access to natural resources - unlocking diplomatic actions.

Every time you start a new game a new world is generated! If you don't like the world you're in, you can press SHIFT+q to quit and start a new game. If you want to keep your current progress and continue later on just close the game window.

There are several types of terrain in the game: plains and hills (easy), forest (moderate), mountains and desert (hard) and marsh (very hard). When the game starts you will probably want to stay very close to the nearest city and level up your party once or twice before adventuring farther. If you're having trouble getting far on the map, select faster starting units or obtain a few class level upgrades first.

Don't forget that fleeing is an option if a situation ever seems less than favorable! Press h in and out of battle for a list of all possible actions. You can also press K to configure your command keys in and out of battle.   

A few nearby locations can help you at the start of the game:
 - Adventurers Guild: trade experience for starting character kits
 - Training Hall: lets you earn experience and feats in a safer environment
 - Temple of Haxor: allows you to do a variety of things during the entire game
 
If you're having trouble raising money when the game starts, try fighting on harder terrain or going to the Adventurers Guild and picking kits for your party. Also, don't hesitate to restart your game early on if you lose one of your party members too soon due to bad luck!
 
The game's main objective is to beat your own highscore, which is recorded when the game ends. The end-goal is to vanquish all Temples and reap your reward with Haxor. Good luck and have fun!
