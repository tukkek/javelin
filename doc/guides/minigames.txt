ARENA
A sequence of battles taking place in the same map - offering buildings that will let you restore and upgrade your units, buy items, recruit allies and more! Gold and experience rewards are increased so that the tension is always ramping up as the match goes on! Take down all enemy rally points to win!

BATTLEFIELD
The purpose of the Battlefield is to pit large armies against each other. There are strategic points placed around the map, assigned to both teams - each generating army points, every turn, that can be used to summon more units into battle! Capture your enemy's control points while fighting for survival!

(Hint: summoning an army worth 10 points is much better than summoning a 5-point army twice - use your points wisely!)

CRIMSON WAR
Become the rising leader of a small contingent - lead them into battle as you benefit from a simple progression system and reinforcements join both sides!

MONSTER MADNESS
A lighthearted but challenging game where you're at a constant disadvantage against powerful enemies. Protect all of your buildings as reinforcements slowly join the fight!
