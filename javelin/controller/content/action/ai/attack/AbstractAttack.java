/**
 * In Javelin 1.7 a new approach of rolling one d20 to resolve attack sequences
 * will be attempted. This is a major win for the game because latter iterative
 * attacks are unlikely to hit, especially on higher levels and represent a
 * major pain for players - even more than inthe tabletop game where it's a
 * constant source of house rules and criticism. It will also help eliminate the
 * number of {@link BattleState} during {@link BattleAi} machinations, which
 * could represent something between a small to huge performance improvement. It
 * also overall helps with attack feeling more powerful and less
 * "choppy"/confusing gameplay overall and removes some implementation
 * complexity of keeping track of {@link AttackSequence} state.
 *
 * The first attack of the sequence will take a {@link ActionCost#STANDARD}
 * action, which is equivalent to both a single-attack sequence and a standard
 * (non-full) attack action. The rest of the attacks take a total of
 * {@link ActionCost#SWIFT} action, which each attempted attack taking an equal
 * share of that total. This makes a full-attack equivalent to a full turn of a
 * Standard, a Swift and a {@link ActionCost#FIVEFOOTSTEP} (1AP total).
 *
 * If an attack fails, the remainder of the sequence is halted, adding an amount
 * of dynamism and unpredactibility to attacking and improving performance since
 * later attacks would fail anyway, assuming they are ordered by attack bonus.
 *
 * Implementation details: for each 5% chance of a d20, a cache is created
 * holding the result of each attack. This cache will determine as equal any
 * rolls with the same results, so that outcome chances can be calculated
 * appropriately instead of generating {@link BattleState}s for all 20
 * possibilities. A second pass will then resolve criticals and a third pass
 * will calculate damage.
 *
 * The heavy lifting is mostly done by {@link AttackResolver}, while this class
 * mostly models different types and attack scenarios and their particularities.
