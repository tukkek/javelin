POTIONS

Potions are one-use items that produce a spell-like effect on the user. Their effect is automatic - no prerequisites or rolls are needed. 

SCROLLS

A scroll is a one-use item that works like a magic spell but requires its reader to have at least one mental attribute score (Intelligence, Wisdom or Charisma) equal or higher to 10 + spell level. The reader's caster level must also be higher than the spell's caster level (see the spell guide for more information). The Spellcraft skill grants bonuses to these calculations.
