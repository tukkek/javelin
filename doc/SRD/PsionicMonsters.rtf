Creatures with psionic powers are similar to creatures with racial spellcasting ability. They have the ability to manifest powers just as a member of a psionic character class can (and can activate psionic items accordingly).

Most psionic monsters have some number of psi-like abilities. These are very similar to spell-like abilities. Naturally, they are psionic and work just like powers or spells. A creature with psi-like abilities does not pay for these abilities with power 
points and does not pay any XP cost associated with manifesting the power the ability duplicates.
\par Psi-like abilities do not work in a }{\i null psionics field }{and are subject to power resistance if the power or spell the ability duplicates would be subject to p
ower resistance. A psi-like ability usually has a limit on how often it can be used. A psi-like ability that can be used at will has no use limit. Using a psi-like ability is a standard action unless noted otherwise, and doing so while threatened provokes
 
attacks of opportunity. It is possible to make a Concentration check to use a psi-like ability defensively and avoid provoking attacks of opportunity, just as when using a power or casting a spell. A psi-like ability can be interrupted just as a spell can
 be. Psi-like abilities cannot be used to counterspell, nor can they be counterspelled.
\par All creatures with psi-like abilities are assigned a manifester level, which indicates how difficult it is to dispel their psi-like effects and determines all level-depe
ndent variables (such as range or duration) the abilities might have. When a creature uses a psi-like ability, the power is manifested as if the creature had spent a number of power points equal to its manifester level, which may augment the power to impr
ove its damage or save DC. However, the creature does not actually spend power points for its psi-like abilities, even if it has a power point reserve due to racial abilities, class levels, or some other psionic ability.
\par The DC of a saving throw (if applicable) against a creature\rquote s psi-like ability is 10 + the level of the power or spell the ability duplicates + the creature\rquote s Cha modifier. Remember to check the power\rquote 
s Augment entry to see if the creature\rquote s manifester level (and thus the effective power point expenditure) increases the DC of the saving throw. Changes to the effect\rquote s save DC, damage, and so on are noted in the psi-like ability entry.

Blues are a subrace of goblins with an innate knack for psionics. A blue is often smaller than an avera
ge goblin, standing just about 3 feet tall and weighing about 40 pounds. Blues have noticeably blue-tinged skin, and their eyes are less dull than those of a common goblin. Otherwise, they resemble their kin. They generally dress in short leather robes, d
yed black.
\par Blues speak Goblin and Common.

(DC 18). Manifester level 7th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.
\par *Includes augmentation for the caller\rquote s manifester level.
\par **Includes the inherent +4 save adjustment described in the power.
\par }{\b Steal Essence (Su):}{ Any living, intelligent creature slain by a caller in darkness\rquote s touch attack is mentally absorbed into the monster\rquote s consciousness. (The physical body of the victim remains intact). Stealing a victim\rquote 
s essence is a free action; it grants the caller 12 temporary hit points, and a permanent new screaming face appears within its cloud.
\par A caller in darkness can also steal the essence of living, intelligent creatures within 30 feet that are paralyzed or sleeping, or that are helpless due to having a mental ability score reduced to 0 (often by the caller\rquote s }{\i ego whip }{
attack). Doing so is a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity. The victim dies, and the caller gains 12 temporary hit points.
\par }{\b Incorporeal Traits:}{ A caller in darkness is harmed only by other incorpore
al creatures, magic weapons, spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities. It has a 50% chance to ignore any damage from a corporeal source, except for force effects or attacks made with ghost touch weapons. It can pass through solid objects, 
but not force effects, at will. Its attacks ignore natural armor, armor, and shields, but deflection bonuses and force effects work normally against them. The creature always moves silently and cannot be heard with Listen checks if it doesn\rquote 
t wish to be. 
\par }{\b Undead Traits:}{ A caller in darkness is immune to mind-affecting effects, poison, }{\i sleep, }{
paralysis, stunning, disease, death effects, and any effect that requires a Fortitude save unless it also works on objects or is harmless. It is not subject to critical 
hits, nonlethal damage, ability damage to its physical ability scores, ability drain, energy drain, fatigue, exhaustion, or death from massive damage. It cannot be raised, and }{\i resurrection }{
works only if it is willing. It has darkvision out to 60 feet.
\par }{\b Unnatural Aura (Su): }{
Animals can sense the unnatural presence of a caller in darkness. Any animal within 30 feet must make a DC 17 Will save or become panicked until it is no longer within 30 feet of the caller in darkness. A panicked creature that is cornered
 begins cowering. The save DC is Charisma-based.
\par }{\b Vulnerability to Sunlight (Ex): }{Callers in darkness are utterly powerless in natural sunlight (not merely a }{\i daylight }{spell) and flee from it. A caller caught in sunlight cannot attack and can take only a sin
gle move action or standard action each turn, but  not both (nor can it take full-round actions).

ork can make a Search check as if he were actively searching, and a duergar can use the Search skill to find stonework traps as a rogue can. A duergar can also intuit depth, sensing his approximate depth underground as naturally as a human can sense which

A folugub can scent a crystal object up to 90 feet away, and once it has the scent, little deters it from its goal. It usually ceases attacking to devour a freshly liquefied crystal. The creature targets the largest crystal object available.
\par }{\b Liquefy Crystal (Ex):}{
 A folugub that makes a successful touch attack with its tongue causes the target crystal to change phase, turning immediately from solid to liquid and becoming worthless. The touch can destroy up to a 5-foot cube of crystal instantly. Magic or psio
nic items made of crystal (including crystalline armor and weapons) must succeed on a DC 19 Reflex save or be liquefied. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +4 racial modifier.
\par A crystalline weapon that deals damage to a folugub becomes liquefied immediately.

\par PHRENIC CREATURE
\par }{Seemingly no different from standard examples of their kind, phrenic creatures harbor mental might.
\par Monsters who naturally
 possess psionic ability are not found as phrenic creatures. Phrenic creatures are freaks among their kind, otherwise normal creatures whose minds are more powerful than those of their fellows. Similarly, creatures who advance by character class are usual
ly not phrenic creatures\emdash they simply take levels in a psionic class to hone their mental powers.

\par }{\'93Phrenic\'94 is an inherited template that can be added to any nonmindless creature that does not already have the psionic subtype (referred to hereafter as the \'93base creature\'94). A phrenic creature uses all the base creature\rquote 
s statistics and special abilities except as noted here.
\par }{\b Size and Type: }{The creature\rquote s type does not change, unless it is an animal (in which case it becomes a magical beast [augmented animal]). It gains the psionic subtype.
\par }{\b Psi-Like Abilities (Sp): }{A phrenic creature possesses the psi-like abilities indicated below, depending on its Hit Dice. The abiliti
es are cumulative. Unless otherwise noted, an ability is usable once per day. Manifester level is equal to the creature\rquote s HD. The save DCs for a phrenic creature\rquote s psi-like abilities are Charisma-based.

A psion-killer does nothing without explicit orders from its creator. It follows instructions literally and is incapable of any strategy or tactics. Psion-killers don\rquote t use weapons, even if ordered to, but always strike with their fists. 
\par A psion-killer\rquote s 
creator can command it if the psion-killer is within 60 feet and can see and hear its creator. If uncommanded, a psion-killer usually follows its last instruction to the best of its ability, though if attacked it returns the attack. Its creator can give a
 psion-killer a simple command to govern its actions in his or her absence.

 To use this ability, a temporal filcher must hit a creature of Large size or smaller with two claw attacks. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking attacks of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a h
old and uses its time filch ability.

\par }{\b Time Filch (Su):}{ If a temporal filcher successfully grapples a Large or smaller creature, it latches onto the opponent\rquote 
s body and shifts 7 minutes forward in time as a free action. Observers (if any) see the temporal filcher and its prey disappear in a shimmer, then reappear 7 minutes la

An udoroot can be killed only if its root is dug up or exposed, then burned, hacked apart, or otherwise destroyed. Severing or destroying all six crowns puts the plant out of commission, allowing excavation of the helpless root. The crowns are Medium obje
cts with a hardness of 5 and 7 hit points. To sever a crown, an opponent must use the sunder action. The crowns can also be affected by spells or effects that affect an area or targeted by spells that affect an individual target.
\par An udoroot takes no damage from having a crown severed or destroyed. A severed crown dies and can no longer be used to attack, but the udoroot takes no other penalties.  As long as the root system remains intact, the crown regrows in about a month.
\par }{\b Double Manifest (Ex):}{ An udoroot senses its surroundings and manifests its psi-like abilities through its crowns. It can manifest two psi-like abilities per round, as long as it has at least two crowns remaining.
\par }{\b Psi-Like Abilities:}{ At will\emdash }{\i energy stun }{(electricity, 2d6, DC 15*), }{\i false sensory input }{(DC 15), }{\i id insinuation }{(two targets, DC 15*), }{\i mind thrust }{(ML 4th, 4d10, DC 14*), }{\i telekinetic force }{
(275 lb., DC 15*), }{\i thought shield }{(power resistance 16*); 3/day\emdash }{\i astral construct }{(3rd level*), }{\i body adjustment, mental barrier. 
\par }{Manifester level 6th. The save DCs are Charisma-based. 
\par An udoroot can use its }{\i body adjustment }{power to repair damage to one of its crowns, as long as the crown has not been severed or destroyed.
\par *Includes augmentation for the udoroot\rquote s manifester level.
\par }{\b Blindsight (Ex): }{An udoroot can ascertain all foes by nonvisual means within 60 feet. If its crowns are destroyed, it can no longer perceive its surroundings.
\par }{\b Plant Traits:}{ An udoroot is immune to poison, }{\i sleep}{, paralysis, stunning, polymorphing, and mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and morale effects). It is not subject to critical hits.
