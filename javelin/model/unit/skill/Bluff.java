/**
 * As long as melee attack misses a target, reduce a small amount of its AC (up
 * to Dex modifier). Reset whenever the unit is hit.
 *
 * This is important because Javelin is a huge miss-fest early on, when so many
 * monsters are small or tiny and with good Dexterity values, resulting in very
 * high AC against BABs as low as literally zero. Even when the skill is
 * untrained, this should help alleviate miss chances a little bit as modifiers
 * pile up.
