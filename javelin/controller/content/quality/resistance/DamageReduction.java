/**
 * A major point of damage reduction in d20 is that it can be entirely bypassed.
 * Since traditional equipment is not a feature of Javelin, it becomes
 * impossible to bypass damage reduction with normal attacks. Instead we apply
 * DR more like a monster's "hardness" (usually reserved for objects).
 *
 * For the same reason, damage reduction can never fully negate damage, only
 * reduce it to 1 point at most. Otherwise with a high enough DR value a unit
 * would literally become immune to damage - especially if a player doesn't have
 * hard-hitting characters and no access to damage upgrades.
 *
 * Having to deal with even 5 points of damage reduction without any ability to
 * bypass it has proven to be entirely too strong, especially when combined with
 * fast healing (such as for mephits). To counteract that we simply reduce all
 * absolute DR values to 1/3 (the "single element" equivalent from the CCR
 * document, by far the most common found in monsters.xml).
 *
 * At some point it may be necessary to more deliberately apply the modifiers
 * from the CCR document, not just x1/3, but currently 100% of the monsters used
 * are single-element-only (either silver or magic).
 *
 * More info on the d20 SRD
