/**
 * An event that always validates as true and does nothing at all. Necessary
 * because there is a very small chance that no other events at all will
 * validate in some {@link EventDeck}.
 *
 * TODO remove once all decks in {@link WildEvents} have at least one
 * always-validating event at least.
 *
 * Despite being pointless, this still has some vaue as a neutral event - the
 * fact you might decide go out of your way for a chance of absolutely nothing
 * happening is, in itself a (admitedly small) strategic decision.
