<Description>
<General>
<p>Aboleth speak their own language, as well as Undercommon and
Aquan.</p>
</General>
<Combat>
<p>An aboleth attacks by flailing with its long, slimy tentacles,
though it prefers to fight from a distance using its illusion
powers.</p>
</Combat>
<SpecialAbilities>
<SpecialAbility Name="Transformation " Type="Ex">
<p>Transformation (Ex): A blow from an aboleth's tentacle
can cause a terrible transformation. Affected creatures must
succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 19) or begin to transform over
the next 1d4+1 minutes, the skin gradually becoming a clear,
slimy membrane. A transformed creature must remain moistened with
cool, fresh water or suffer 1d12 points of damage every 10
minutes. A remove disease spell cast before the transformation is
complete will restore an afflicted creature to normal. Afterward,
however, only a heal or mass heal spell can reverse the change.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Psionics " Type="Sp">
<p>Psionics (Sp): At will: hypnotic pattern, illusory wall,
mirage arcana, persistent image, programmed image, project image,
and veil. These effects are as the spells cast by a 16th-level
sorcerer (save DCs, where applicable, are 13 + spell level).</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Enslave " Type="Su">
<p>Enslave (Su): Three times a day, an aboleth can attempt to
enslave any one living creature within 30 feet. The target must
succeed at a Will save (DC 17) or be affected as though by a
dominate person spell cast by a 16th-level sorcerer. An enslaved
creature obeys the aboleth's telepathic commands (but will
not fight on its behalf) until freed by remove curse or dispel
magic, and can attempt a new Will save every 24 hours to break
free. The control is also broken if the aboleth dies or travels
more than one mile from its slave.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Mucus Cloud " Type="Ex">
<p>Mucus Cloud (Ex): An aboleth underwater surrounds itself with
a viscous cloud of mucus roughly 1 foot thick. Any creature
coming into contact with and inhaling this substance must succeed
at a Fortitude save (DC 19) or lose the ability to breathe air
for the next 3 hours. The affected creature suffocates in 2d6
minutes if removed from the water. Renewed contact with the mucus
cloud and failing another Fortitude save continues the effect for
another 3 hours.</p>

<p>Achaierai speak Infernal.</p>
</General>
<Combat>
<p>In close combat, achaierai lash out with two of their four
legs and snap with their powerful beaks. These attack modes alone
would make them deadly warriors.</p>
</Combat>
<SpecialAbilities>
<SpecialAbility Name="Black Cloud " Type="Ex">
<p>Black Cloud (Ex): Up to three times per day an achaierai can
release a choking, toxic black cloud. Those other than achaierai
within 10 feet instantly take 2d6 points of damage. They must
also succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 15) or be affected for 3
hours as though by an insanity spell cast by a 16th-level
sorcerer.</p>

<General/>
<Combat>
<p>Allips are unable to cause physical harm, although they
don't appear to know that. They keep flailing away at their
enemies, yet they inflict no wounds.</p>
</Combat>
<SpecialAbilities>
<SpecialAbility Name="Babble " Type="Su">
<p>Babble (Su): An allip constantly mutters and whines to itself,
creating a hypnotic effect. All sane creatures within 60 feet of
the allip must succeed at a Will save (DC 16) or be affected as
though by a hypnotism spell for 2d4 rounds. This is a sonic,
mind-affecting compulsion. Opponents who successfully save cannot
be affected by the same allip's babble for one day.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Wisdom Drain " Type="Su">
<p>Wisdom Drain (Su): Those whose Wisdom is reduced to 0 by the
allip become helpless until at least 1 point of Wisdom is
restored.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Madness " Type="Su">
<p>Madness (Su): Anyone targeting the allip with a mind-control
or telepathic ability makes direct contact with its tortured mind
and takes 1d4 points of temporary Wisdom damage.</p>

<Description>
<General/>
<Combat>
<p>An ankheg usually lies 5 to 10 feet below the surface until
its antennae detect the approach of prey. It then burrows up to
attack. (Treat this as a charge.)</p>
</Combat>
<SpecialAbilities>
<SpecialAbility Name="Improved Grab " Type="Ex">
<p>Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, the ankheg must hit
with its bite attack. If it gets a hold, it deals automatic bite
damage each round the hold is maintained. If the ankheg is
damaged after grabbing its prey, it retreats backward down its
tunnel at burrowing speed, dragging the victim with it.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Acid " Type="Ex">
<p>Acid (Ex): Acidic enzymes drip from an ankheg's mouth
each round it maintains a hold. It automatically deals 1d4 points
of acid damage each round in addition to bite damage.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Spit Acid " Type="Ex">
<p>Spit Acid (Ex): Stream of acid 5 feet high, 5 feet wide, and
30 feet long, once every 6 hours; damage 4d4, Reflex half DC 14.
One such attack depletes the ankheg's acid supply for 6
hours. It cannot spit acid or deal acid damage during this time.
Ankhegs do not use this ability unless they are desperate or
frustrated. They most often spit acid when reduced to fewer than
half their hit points or when they have not successfully grabbed
an opponent.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Tremorsense " Type="Ex">
<p>Tremorsense (Ex): Ankhegs can automatically sense the location
of anything within 60 feet that is in contact with the ground.</p>

<Description>
<General>
<p>Araneas speak Common and Sylvan.</p>
</General>
<Combat>
<p>Araneas avoid physical combat and use their webs and spells
when they can. In a battle, they try to immobilize or distract
the most aggressive opponents first. Araneas often subdue
opponents for ransom.</p>
</Combat>
<SpecialAbilities>
<SpecialAbility Name="Spells" Type="Ex">
<p>Spells: Araneas cast spells as 3rd-level sorcerers (save DC 12
+ spell level). They prefer illusions and charms but avoid fire
spells.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Web " Type="Ex">
<p>Web (Ex): In spider or hybrid form (see Alternate Form,
below), an aranea can cast a web up to six times per day. This is
similar to an attack with a net but has a maximum range of 50
feet, with a range increment of 10 feet, and is effective against
targets of up to Large size. The web anchors the target in place,
allowing no movement. An entangled creature can escape with a
successful Escape Artist check (DC 20) or burst the web with a
successful Strength check (DC 26). The web has 6 hit points and
takes double damage from fire.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Poison " Type="Ex">
<p>Poison (Ex): Bite, Fortitude save (DC 13); initial damage 1d6
temporary Strength, secondary damage 2d6 temporary Strength.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Alternate Form " Type="Su">
<p>Alternate Form (Su): An aranea's natural form is that of
a Large monstrous spider. It can assume two other forms. The
first is a Small or Medium-size humanoid (the exact form is fixed
at birth). The second form is a Medium-size, spider-humanoid
hybrid. Changing form is a standard action. In humanoid form, the
aranea gains all the abilities of the form (for example, an
aranea in dwarf form has dwarven racial traits). The aranea keeps
its ability scores and can cast spells, but it cannot use webs or
poison in humanoid form. In hybrid form, an aranea looks like a
humanoid at first glance, but a successful Spot check (DC 18)
reveals the creature's fangs and spinnerets. The aranea can
use weapons and webs in this form. An aranea remains in one form
until it chooses to assume a new one. A change in form cannot be
dispelled, nor does the aranea revert to its natural form when
killed. A true seeing spell, however, reveals its natural form if
it is in humanoid or hybrid form.</p>

<Combat>
<p>Assassin vines use simple tactics: They lie still until prey
comes within reach, then attack. They use their entangle ability
both to catch prey and to deter counterattacks.</p>

<SpecialAbility Name="Entangle " Type="Su">
<p>Entangle (Su): An assassin vine can animate plants within 30
feet of itself as a free action. The effect lasts until the vine
dies or decides to end it (also a free action). The ability is
otherwise similar to entangle as cast by a 4th-level druid (save
DC 13).</p>

<SpecialAbility Name="Camouflage " Type="Ex">
<p>Camouflage (Ex): Since an assassin vine looks like a normal
plant when at rest, it takes a successful Spot check (DC 20) to
notice it before it attacks. Anyone with Survival or
Knowledge (plants or herbs) can use those skills instead of Spot
to notice the plant. Dwarves can use stonecunning to notice the
subterranean version.</p>

<p>Athachs charge into melee combat unless their opponents are
out of reach, in which case they throw rocks. They sometimes try
to overrun armored opponents to reach unarmored opponents in back
ranks. With their first few melee attacks, athachs tend to flail
about indiscriminately. After a few rounds, they concentrate on
foes that have been hitting them most often and use their bites
on whoever has dealt them the most damage.</p>

</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Improved Grab " Type="Ex">
<p>Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, the behir must hit

<SpecialAbility Name="Swallow Whole " Type="Ex">
<p>Swallow Whole (Ex): A behir can try to swallow a grabbed
Medium-size or smaller opponent by making a successful grapple
check. A behir that swallows an opponent can use its Cleave feat
to bite and grab another opponent. The swallowed creature takes
2d8+8 points of crushing damage and 8 points of acid damage per
round from the behir's gizzard. A swallowed creature can
also cut its way out by using claws or a Small or Tiny slashing
weapon to deal 25 points of damage to the gizzard (AC 20). Once
the creature exits, muscular action closes the hole; another
swallowed opponent must again cut its own way out.  The behir's
gizzard can hold two Medium-size, four Small, eight Tiny, sixteen
Diminutive, or thirty-two Fine or smaller opponents.</p>

<Description>
<General>
<p>Beholders speak their own language and the Common tongue.</p>
</General>
<SpecialAbilities>
<SpecialAbility Name="Eye Rays " Type="Su">
<p>Eye Rays (Su): Each of the ten small eyes can produce a
magical ray once a round, even when the beholder is attacking
physically or moving at full speed. The creature can easily aim
all its eyes upward, but its own body tends to get in the way
when it tries to aim the rays in other directions. During a
round, the creature can aim only three eye rays at targets in any
one arc other than up (forward, backward, left, right, or down).
The remaining eyes must aim at targets in other arcs or not at
all. A beholder can tilt and pan its body each round to change
which rays it can bring to bear in an arc. Each eye's effect
resembles a spell cast by a 13th-level sorcerer but follows the
rules for a ray. All rays have a range of 150 feet and a save DC
of 18.
<ul>
<li>Charm Person: The target must succeed at a Will save or
be affected as though by the spell. Beholders use this
ray to confuse the opposition, usually employing it early
in a fight. The beholder generally instructs a charmed
target to either restrain a comrade or stand aside.</li>
<li>Charm Monster: The target must succeed at a Will save or
be affected as though by the spell. Beholders use this
ray in the same manner as the charm person ray.</li>
<li>Sleep: This works like the spell, except that it affects
one creature with any number of Hit Dice. The target must
succeed at a Will save to resist. Beholders like to use
this ray against warriors and other physically powerful
creatures. They know their foes can quickly awaken the
sleepers, but they also know that doing so takes time and
can delay an effective counterattack.</li>
<li>Flesh to Stone: The target must succeed at a Fortitude
save or be affected as though by the spell. Beholders
like to aim this ray at enemy spellcasters. They also use
it on any creature whose appearance they find
interesting. (After the fight, the beholder takes the
statue to its lair as a decoration.)</li>
<li>Disintegrate: The target must succeed at a Fortitude save
or be affected as though by the spell. The beholder likes
to use this ray on any foe it considers a real threat.</li>
<li>Fear: This works like the spell, except that it targets
one creature. The target must succeed at a Will save or
be affected as though by the spell. Beholders like to use
this ray against warriors and other powerful creatures
early in a fight, to break up the opposition.</li>
<li>Slow: This works like the spell, except that it affects
one creature. The target must make a Will save to resist.
Beholders often use this ray against the same creature
targeted by their disintegrate, flesh to stone, or finger
of death rays. If one of the former rays fails to
eliminate the foe, this ray might at least hamper it.</li>
<li>Inflict Moderate Wounds: This works just like the spell,
causing 2d8+10 points of damage (Will half).</li>
<li>Finger of Death: The target must succeed at a Fortitude
save or be slain as though by the spell. The target
suffers 3d6+13 damage if his saving throw succeeds.
Beholders use this ray to eliminate dangerous foes
quickly.</li>
<li>Telekinesis: The beholder can move objects or creatures
that weigh up to 325 pounds, as though with a telekinesis
spell. Creatures can resist the effect with a successful
Will save.</li>
<li>All-Around Vision (Ex): Beholders are exceptionally alert
and circumspect. Their many eyes give them a +4 racial
bonus to Spot and Search checks, and they can't be
flanked.</li>
</ul></p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Antimagic Cone " Type="Su">
<p>Antimagic Cone (Su): A beholder's central eye continually
produces a 150-foot antimagic cone extending straight ahead
from the creature's front. This functions just like
antimagic field cast by a 13th-level sorcerer. All magical and
supernatural powers and effects within the cone are
suppressed-even the beholder's own eye rays. Once each
round, during its turn, the beholder decides which way it will
face, and whether the antimagic cone is active or not (the
beholder deactivates the cone by shutting its central eye). Note
that a beholder can bite only creatures to its front.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Flight " Type="Ex">
<p>Flight (Ex): A beholder's body is naturally buoyant. This
buoyancy allows it to fly as the spell, as a free action, at a
speed of 20 feet. This buoyancy also grants it a permanent
feather fall effect with personal range. </p>

<p>In most cases, a belker fights with its nasty claws and
painful bite.</p>
</Combat>
<SpecialAbilities>
<SpecialAbility Name="Smoke Claws " Type="Ex">
<p>Smoke Claws (Ex): A belker in smoke form (see below) can
engulf opponents by moving on top of them. It fills the air
around one Medium-size or smaller opponent without provoking an
attack of opportunity. The target must succeed at a Fortitude
save (DC 14) or inhale part of the creature. Smoke inside the
victim solidifies into a claw or talon and begins to rip at the
surrounding organs, dealing 3d4 points of damage per round. The
affected creature can attempt another Fortitude save each
subsequent round to cough out the semivaporous menace.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Smoke Form " Type="Su">
<p>Smoke Form (Su): Most of the time a belker is more or less
solid, but at will it can assume a smoke form. It can switch
forms once a round as a free action and can spend up to 20 rounds
per day in smoke form. A belker in smoke form can fly at a speed
of 50 feet (perfect maneuverability). The ability is otherwise
similar to a gaseous form spell cast by a 7th-level sorcerer.</p>

about an opponent (randomly determined, if more than one opponent
is present) that causes it to recall its life. If this happens,
the bodak takes no action for 1 round and thereafter suffers a -2

if they spy prey, return to report and bring up reinforcements.
Bugbear attacks are coordinated, and their tactics are sound if
not brilliant.</p>
</Combat>
<Skills>
<p>Skills: Bugbears receive a +4 racial bonus to Move Silently
checks.</p>
</Skills>
<Characters>
<p>A bugbear's favored class is rogue. Most bugbear leaders

<p>Carrion crawlers use their keen senses of sight and smell to

<p>Centaurs speak Sylvan and Elven.</p>

<Combat>
<p>Centaurs usually don't provoke a fight. Their normal
response to aggression is swift retreat, perhaps launching a few
arrows to discourage pursuit. Against creatures dangerous to
their communities, they use much the same tactics, except that
about half their number will circle around to lie in ambush or
attack the foe from the rear.</p>
</Combat>
<Characters>
<p>Centaurs sometimes become bards, rangers, or druids. Their
favored class is ranger. Centaur rangers often choose a magical
beast or some variety of humanoid as their favored enemy. Centaur

<General>
<p>Chaos beasts do not speak.</p>
</General>
<Combat>
<p>Regardless of form, the creature seems unable to manage more
than two attacks per round. Its continual transmutations prevent
the coordination needed to do more.</p>
</Combat>
<SpecialAbilities>
<SpecialAbility Name="Corporeal Instability " Type="Su">
<p>Corporeal Instability (Su): A blow from a chaos beast can
cause a terrible transformation. A living creature must succeed
at a Fortitude save (DC 15) or become a spongy, amorphous mass.
Unless controlled through an act of will, the victim's shape
melts, flows, writhes, and boils. The affected creature is unable
to hold or use any item. Clothing, armor, rings, helmets, and
backpacks become useless. Large items: armor, backpacks, even
shirts hamper more than help, reducing the creature's
Dexterity score by 4. Soft or misshapen feet and legs reduce
speed to 10 feet or one-quarter normal, whichever is less.
Searing pain courses along the nerves, so strong that the
creature cannot act coherently. It cannot cast spells or use
magic items, and it attacks blindly, unable to distinguish friend
from foe (-4 penalty to hit and a 50% miss chance, regardless of
the attack roll). Each round the creature spends in an amorphous
state deals 1 point of permanent Wisdom drain from mental shock.
If the creature's Wisdom score falls to 0, it becomes a
chaos beast itself. A creature with a strong sense of self can
regain its own shape by taking a standard action to attempt a
Charisma check (DC 15). A success reestablishes the
creature's normal form for 1 minute. On a failure, the
creature can still repeat the check each round until successful.
Corporeal instability is not a disease or a curse and so is hard
to remove. A shapechange or stoneskin spell does not cure the
afflicted creature but fixes its form for the duration of the
spell. A restoration, heal, or greater restoration spell removes
the affliction (a separate restoration is necessary to restore
any lost Wisdom).</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Immune to Transformation " Type="Ex">
<p>Immune to Transformation (Ex): No mortal magic can affect or
fix a chaos beast's form. Effects such as polymorph or
petrification force the creature into a new shape for a moment,
but it immediately returns to its mutable form as a free action.</p>

<p>A chuul prefers to wait by the shore, submerged in murky
water, until it hears nearby prey (in or out of the water) that
it can attack with surprise. A chuul facing multiple opponents
grabs with its claws and crushes its foes, then passes one
opponent to its tentacles. It tries to always have one claw free,
so if it faces a great number of opponents, it drops paralyzed or
dead victims without eating them and continues grabbing,
crushing, and paralyzing the rest.</p>

<Combat>
<p>Cloakers usually lie still, watching and listening for prey.
If facing a single opponent, a cloaker uses its engulf attack.
Against multiple foes, it lashes with its tail in concert with
its moan and shadow shift abilities to reduce the
opposition's numbers, then engulfs a survivor. Multiple
cloakers usually split up, leaving one or two behind to use
special abilities while the rest attack.</p>
</Combat>
<SpecialAbilities>
<SpecialAbility Name="Moan " Type="Ex">
<p>Moan (Ex): A cloaker can emit a dangerous subsonic moan
instead of biting. By changing the frequency, the cloaker may
cause one of four effects. Cloakers are immune to these sonic,
mind-affecting attacks. Unless noted otherwise, creatures who
successfully save against these effects cannot be affected by the
same moan effect from the same cloaker for one day.
<ul>
<li>Unnerve: All within an 80-foot spread automatically
suffer a -2 morale penalty to attack and damage rolls.
Those forced to hear the moan for more than 6 consecutive
rounds must succeed at a Will save (DC 15) or enter a
trance, unable to attack or defend themselves until the
moaning stops. Even on a success, they must repeat the
save in each round the moaning continues.</li>
<li>Fear: All those within a 30-foot spread must succeed at a
Will save (DC 15) or flee in terror for 2 rounds.</li>
<li>Nausea: Everyone in a 30-foot cone must succeed at a
Fortitude save (DC 15) or be overcome by nausea and
weakness. Affected characters fall to the ground and are
unable to take any actions, including defending
themselves, for 1d4+1 rounds.</li>
<li>Stupor: A single creature within 30 feet of the cloaker
must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 15) or be affected
as though by a hold person spell for 5 rounds. Even after
a successful save, the creature must repeat the save if
the cloaker uses this effect again.</li>
</ul></p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Engulf " Type="Ex">
<p>Engulf (Ex): A cloaker can try to wrap a Medium-size or
smaller creature in its body as a standard action. The cloaker
attempts a grapple that does not provoke an attack of
opportunity. If it gets a hold, it bites the engulfed victim with

<SpecialAbility Name="Corrosive Slime " Type="Ex">
<p>Corrosive Slime (Ex): Delvers produce a mucuslike slime that
contains a highly corrosive substance. The slime is particularly
effective against stone. A delver's mere touch deals 2d6
points of damage to organic creatures or objects. Against
metallic creatures or objects, a delver's slime deals 4d8
points of damage, and against stony creatures (including earth
elementals) or objects it deals 8d10 points of damage. A slam
attack by a delver leaves a patch of slime that deals 2d6 points
of damage on contact and another 2d6 points of damage in each of
the next 2 rounds. A large quantity (at least a quart) of water
or weak acid, such as vinegar, washes off the slime. An
opponent's armor and clothing dissolve and become useless
immediately unless the wearer succeeds at a Reflex save (DC 22).
Weapons that strike a delver also dissolve immediately unless the
wielder succeeds at a Reflex save (DC 22). Creatures attacking
the delver with natural weapons take damage from the slime each
time their attacks hit unless they succeed at Reflex saves (DC
22).</p>

<Description>
<General>
<p>A destrachan speaks no language but understands Common. If one
must communicate, it does so through action.</p>
</General>
<Combat>
<p>A destrachan uses its claws only as a last resort or to finish
off foes weakened by its sonic attacks. Being extremely
intelligent, it often enters battle with surprise if possible. It
first focuses on destroying metal armor and weapons and then
changes to harmonics that disrupt flesh.</p>
</Combat>
<SpecialAbilities>
<SpecialAbility Name="Destructive Harmonics " Type="Su">
<p>Destructive Harmonics (Su): A destrachan can blast sonic
energy in a cone up to 80 feet long. It can tune the harmonics of
this destructive power to affect different types of targets.
<ul>
<li>Flesh: Disrupting tissue and rending bone, this horrible
attack deals 4d6 points of damage to all within the cone
(Reflex half DC 15).</li>
<li>Nerves: The destrachan can focus its harmonics to subdue
rather than slay. This attack plays havoc with nerves and
sensory systems, dealing 6d6 points of subdual damage to
all within the cone (Reflex half DC 15).</li>
<li>Material: The destrachan chooses wood, stone, metal, or
glass. All objects made of that material within the cone
must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 15) or shatter.
Objects (or portions of objects) that have up to 30 hit
points are potentially affected by this attack.</li>
</ul></p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Reverberating Harmonics " Type="Su">
<p>Reverberating Harmonics (Su): The destrachan can use a wall, a
ceiling, or even a floor to reflect any of the sonic attacks
listed above (except those that would damage the reflecting
surface). This attack affects all within 30 feet of the
destrachan, which is immune to the effects of its own ability.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Blindsight " Type="Ex">
<p>Blindsight (Ex): A destrachan can use hearing to ascertain all
foes within 100 feet as a sighted creature would.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Protection from Sonics " Type="Ex">
<p>Protection from Sonics (Ex): While they can be affected by
loud noises and sonic spells (such as ghost sound or silence),
destrachans are less vulnerable to sound-based attacks (+4
circumstance bonus on all saves) because they can protect their
ears. A destrachan whose sense of hearing is impaired is
effectively blind, treating all targets as totally concealed.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

existence, the destrachan gains a +10 racial bonus to Listen

<SpecialAbilities>
<SpecialAbility Name="Energy Drain " Type="Su">
<p>Energy Drain (Su): Living creatures hit by a devourer's
claw attack or spectral hand ability receive one negative level.
The Fortitude save to remove the negative level has a DC of 19.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Trap Essence " Type="Su">
<p>Trap Essence (Su): The devourer is named for its ability to
consume an enemy's life essence. To do so, it must forgo its
normal melee attacks and make a trap essence attack. This
requires a normal attack roll to hit but deals no damage. The
affected creature must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 19) or die
instantly. The slain creature's essence is trapped within
the devourer's ribs, and the diminutive figure takes on that
victim's features. The trapped essence cannot be raised or
resurrected, but a limited wish, miracle, or wish spell frees it,
as does destroying the devourer. A devourer can hold only one
essence at a time. The trapped essence provides the devourer with
enough power to use five spell-like abilities per HD or level of
the trapped creature. As this energy is expended, the twisted
soul fades away until it evaporates completely. The trapped
essence receives one negative level for every five spell-like
uses. When the number of negative levels equals the
creature's total HD or level, the essence is destroyed. If
an essence is freed, the restored creature must succeed at a
Fortitude save (DC 17) for each negative level or lose that level
permanently.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Spell-Like Abilities" Type="Ex">
<p>Spell-Like Abilities: At the start of any encounter, the
trapped essence within a devourer is assumed to have 3d4+3 levels
(enough fuel for 30 to 75 uses). Once per round, the devourer can
use one of following as the spell cast by an 18th-level sorcerer
(save DC 13 + spell level): confusion, control undead, ghoul
touch, lesser planar ally, ray of enfeeblement, spectral hand,
suggestion, and true seeing.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Undead" Type="Ex">
<p>Undead: Immune to mind-influencing effects, poison, sleep,
paralysis, stunning, and disease. Not subject to critical hits,
subdual damage, ability damage, energy drain, or death from
massive damage.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Spell Deflection " Type="Su">
<p>Spell Deflection (Su): The trapped essence provides a measure
of magical protection. If any of the following spells are cast at
the devourer and overcome its spell resistance, they affect the
imprisoned essence instead: banishment, chaos hammer, confusion,
detect thoughts, dispel evil, dominate person, emotion, fear,
geas/quest, holy word, hypnosis, imprisonment, magic jar, maze,
suggestion, trap the soul, or any form of charm or compulsion. In
many cases, this effectively neutralizes the spell (charming a
trapped essence, for example, is useless). Some of them
(banishment, for example), might eliminate the trapped essence,
robbing the devourer of its magical powers until it can consume
another.</p>

<p>Ettercaps are not brave creatures, but their cunning traps

claws and venomous bite.</p>
</Combat>
<SpecialAbilities>
<SpecialAbility Name="Web " Type="Ex">
<p>Web (Ex): An ettercap can cast a web eight times per day. This
is similar to an attack with a net but has a maximum range of 50
feet, with a range increment of 10 feet, and is effective against
targets of up to Medium-size (see page 102 in the Player's
Handbook for details on net attacks). The web anchors the target
in place, allowing no movement. An entangled creature can escape
with a successful Escape Artist check (DC 20) or burst the web
with a successful Strength check (DC 26). The web has 6 hit
points and takes double damage from fire. Ettercaps can also
create sheets of sticky webbing from 5 to 60 feet square. They
usually position these to snare flying creatures but can also try
to trap prey on the ground. Approaching creatures must succeed at
a Spot check (DC 20) to notice a web or stumble into it and
become trapped as though by a successful web attack. Attempts to
escape or burst the webbing receive a +5 bonus if the trapped
creature has something to walk on or grab while pulling free.
Each 5-foot-square section has 6 hit points and takes double
damage from fire. An ettercap can move across its own sheet web
at its climb speed and can determine the exact location of any
creature touching the web.</p>

Orc, Goblin, and Giant. Creatures that can speak any of these
languages must succeed at an Intelligence check (DC 15) to

<SpecialAbility Name="Trill " Type="Su">
<p>Trill (Su): The frost worm can emit a noise that forces its
prey to stand motionless. This sonic, mind affecting compulsion
affects all creatures other than frost worms within a 100-foot
spread. Creatures must succeed at a Will save (DC 17) or be
stunned for as long as the worm trills, even if they are
attacked. However, if attacked or violently shaken (a full-round
action), a victim is allowed another saving throw. Once a
creature has resisted or broken the effect, it cannot be affected
again by that frost worm for one day. The effect's caster
level is 14.</p>

<p>Gibbering mouthers can speak Common, but seldom say anything
other than gibbering.</p>
</General>
<Combat>
<p>Gibbering mouthers attack by shooting out strings of
protoplasmic flesh, each ending in one or more eyes and a mouth
that bites at the enemy. A mouther can send out a total of six
such members in any round.</p>
</Combat>
<SpecialAbilities>
<SpecialAbility Name="Gibbering " Type="Su">
<p>Gibbering (Su): As soon as a mouther spots something edible,
it begins a constant gibbering as a free action. All creatures
(other than mouthers) within a 60-foot spread must succeed at a
Will save (DC 13) or be affected as though by a confusion spell
for 1d2 rounds. This is a sonic, mind-affecting compulsion
effect. Opponents who successfully save cannot be affected by the
same gibbering mouther's gibbering for one day.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Spittle " Type="Ex">
<p>Spittle (Ex): At the start of every combat, and every 2 rounds
thereafter, a gibbering mouther looses a stream of spittle. This
ignites on contact with the air, creating a blinding flash of
light. All sighted creatures within 60 feet must succeed at a
Fortitude save (DC 13) or be blinded for 1d3 rounds.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Improved Grab " Type="Ex">
<p>Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, the gibbering mouther
must hit with a bite attack.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Blood Drain " Type="Ex">
<p>Blood Drain (Ex): On a second successful grapple check after
grabbing, that mouth attaches to the opponent. It automatically
deals bite damage and drains blood, dealing 1 point of temporary
Constitution damage each round. A mouth can be ripped off
(dealing 1 point of damage) with a successful Strength check (DC
12) or severed by a normal attack that deals at least 2 points of
damage (AC 18). A severed mouth continues to bite and drain blood
for 1d4 rounds after such an attack. A creature whose
Constitution is reduced to 0 is killed and absorbed by the
mouther, which gains 1 hit point and adds another mouth and pair
of eyes to its body.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Engulf " Type="Ex">
<p>Engulf (Ex): A gibbering mouther can try to engulf a
Medium-size or smaller opponent grabbed by three or more mouths.
The opponent must succeed at a Reflex save (DC 14) or fall and be
engulfed. On the next round, the mouther makes twelve bite
attacks instead of six (each with a +4 attack bonus). An engulfed
creature cannot attack the mouther from within. The previously
attached mouths are now free to attack others.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Ground Manipulation " Type="Su">
<p>Ground Manipulation (Su): At will, as a standard action, a
gibbering mouther can cause stone and earth within 5 feet of it
to become a morass akin to quicksand. Softening earth, sand, or
the like takes 1 round, while stone takes 2 rounds. Anyone other
than the mouther in that area must take a move equivalent action
to avoid becoming mired (treat as being pinned).</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Amorphous " Type="Ex">
<p>Amorphous (Ex): A gibbering mouther is not subject to critical
hits. It has no clear front or back, so it cannot be flanked.</p>
</SpecialAbility>
</SpecialAbilities>
<Skills>
<p>Skills: Thanks to their multiple eyes, gibbering mouthers
receive a +4 racial bonus to Spot checks.</p>

<Combat>
<p>They hunt by holing up near high-traffic areas, using their
natural coloration to blend into convenient shadows. When prey
(virtually anything that moves) ventures near, they lash out with
their tentacles. A grick's rubbery body seems to shed blows
of any kind. Its jaws are relatively small and weak compared to
its body mass, so rather than consume its kill immediately, the
grick normally drags its victim back to its lair to be eaten at
its leisure.</p>

<p>Blindsight (Ex): Grimlocks can ascertain all foes within 40
feet as a sighted creature would. Beyond that range, they treat
all targets as totally concealed.  Grimlocks are susceptible to
sound and scent based attacks, however, and are affected normally
by loud noises and sonic spells (such as ghost sound or silence)
and overpowering odors (such as stinking cloud or incense-heavy
air). Negating a grimlock's sense of smell or hearing reduces
this ability to normal Blind-Fight (as the feat). If both are negated,
the grimlock is effectively blinded.</p>

<p>When a harpy engages in battle, it prefers to use Flyby Attack
and strike with a melee weapon.</p>
</Combat>
<SpecialAbilities>
<SpecialAbility Name="Captivating Song " Type="Su">
<p>Captivating Song (Su): The most insidious ability of the harpy
is its song. When a harpy sings, all creatures (other than
harpies) within a 300-foot spread must succeed at a Will save (DC
15) or become utterly captivated. This is a sonic, mind-affecting
charm. If the save is successful, that creature cannot be
affected again by that harpy's song for one day. A
captivated victim walks toward the harpy, taking the most direct
route available. If the path leads into a dangerous area, that
creature gets a second saving throw. Captivated creatures can
take no actions other than to defend themselves. A victim within
5 feet of the harpy stands there and offers no resistance to the
monster's attacks. The effect continues for as long as the
harpy sings. A bard's countersong ability allows the
captivated creature to attempt a new Will save.</p>

<p>Homunculi land on their victims and bite with their venomous
fangs.</p>

<SpecialAbilities>
<SpecialAbility Name="Poison " Type="Ex">
<p>Poison (Ex): Bite, Fortitude save (DC 11); initial damage
sleep for 1 minute, secondary damage sleep for another 5d6
minutes.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Construct" Type="Ex">
<p>Construct: Immune to mind-influencing effects, poison,
disease, and similar effects. Not subject to critical hits,
subdual damage, ability damage, energy drain, or death from
massive damage.</p>
</SpecialAbility>
</SpecialAbilities>
<Construction>
<p>A homunculus costs 100 gp to create, including 20 gp for the
body. This cost includes all the materials and spell components
that are consumed by or become a permanent part of the creation.</p>

<p>Creating the body requires a Craft (sculpture or masonry)
check (DC of 12).</p>

<p>After the body is sculpted, it is animated through an extended
magical ritual that requires a 7th-level character with the Craft
Wondrous Item feat. This ritual requires a week to complete: The
creator must labor for at least 8 hours each day in a specially
prepared laboratory or workroom, similar to an alchemist's
laboratory and costing 500 gp to establish. If the creator is
personally constructing the creature's body, the building
and ritual can be performed together.</p>

<p>A character not actively working on the ritual must rest and
can perform no other activities except eating, sleeping, or
talking. If he or she misses a day, the process fails, and the
ritual must be started anew; any gp spent on the failed ritual is
lost (but not XP). The previously crafted body can be reused, as
can the laboratory.</p>

<p>Completing the ritual requires casting arcane eye, mirror
image, and mending on the final day of the ritual and drains 25
XP from the creator. He or she must cast the spells personally,
but they can come from outside sources, such as scrolls.</p>

<General/>
<Combat>
<p>Howlers attack in groups, for they are cowardly and cruel.
They prefer to charge into combat, race out, and then charge in
again.</p>
</Combat>
<SpecialAbilities>
<SpecialAbility Name="Quills " Type="Ex">
<p>Quills (Ex): The howler's neck bristles with long quills.
While biting, the creature thrashes about, striking with 1d4 of
them. An opponent hit by the howler's quill attack must make
a Reflex save (DC 16) or have the quill break off in his or her
flesh. A lodged quill imposes a -1 circumstance penalty to
attacks, saves, and checks. Removing the quill deals 1d6
additional points of damage.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Howl " Type="Ex">
<p>Howl (Ex): All beings other than outsiders that hear the
creature's howling for an hour or more are subject to its
effect, though it does not help the howler in combat. Those
within a 100-foot spread must succeed at a Will save (DC 12) or
take 1 point of temporary Wisdom damage. The save must be
repeated for each hour of exposure. This is a sonic,
mind-affecting attack; deafened creatures are not subject to it.</p>
</SpecialAbility>
</SpecialAbilities>
<Training>
<p>Small and Medium-size infernal creatures such as quasits,
abyssal orcs, or even succubi sometimes use howlers as mounts or
pack animals. They are particularly useful underground. Larger
and more powerful demons use them like hunting dogs.</p>

<p>Training a howler requires a successful Handle Animal check
(DC 23 for a young creature, or DC 30 for an adult) and that the
creature be willing. Trainers can reduce the DC by 5 and the
rearing time by one-half by using a magic harness enchanted for
the purpose. Riding a howler requires an exotic saddle. A howler
can fight while carrying a rider, but the rider cannot also
attack unless he or she succeeds at a Ride check.</p>
</Training>
<CarryingCapacity>
<p>Carrying Capacity: A light load for a howler is up to 460
pounds; a medium load, 461-920 pounds; and a heavy load,
921-1,380 pounds. A howler can drag 6,900 pounds.</p>

<Combat>
<p>Krenshars use solitary scouts to drive prey into the waiting
clutches of the pack. The scout appears from hiding, uses its
scare ability, then chases the fleeing target to join the attack.</p>

<p>Scare (Ex or Su): As a standard action, a krenshar can pull
the skin back from its head, revealing the musculature and bony
structures of its skull. This alone is usually sufficient to
scare away foes (treat as a Bluff check with a +3 bonus).
Combining this scare ability with a loud screech produces an
unsettling effect that works like scare cast by a 3rd-level
sorcerer (save DC 12). If the save is successful, that opponent
cannot be affected again by that krenshar's scare ability
for one day. The shriek does not affect other krenshars.</p>

<General>
<p>Kuotoas speak Kuo-Toan, Undercommon, and Aquan.</p>
</General>
<Combat>
<p>Kuo-toan tactics and weapons vary greatly depending upon the
training and skills of the individual encountered. A group of
kuo-toa warriors usually fight in formation, throwing their
spears before closing to melee range.</p>
</Combat>
<SpecialAbilities>
<SpecialAbility Name="Lightning Bolt " Type="Su">
<p>Lightning Bolt (Su): Two or more kuo-toa clerics (known as
"whips") operating together can generate a stroke of
lightning every 1d4 rounds. The whips must join hands to launch
the bolt but need merely remain within 30 feet of one another
while it builds. The lightning bolt deals 1d6 points of damage
per whip, but a successful Reflex save halves this amount (save
DC 13 + number of whips).</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Pincer Staff " Type="Ex">
<p>Pincer Staff (Ex): Many kuo-toa fighters and all whips above
6th level carry this Large exotic weapon. A pincer staff deals 1d10
points of bludgeoning damage, threatens a critical hit on a 20,
and deals double damage on a critical hit. It has a 10-foot reach
and cannot be used against an adjacent opponent. A wielder that
hits an opponent of at least Small but no larger than Large size
attempts to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an
attack of opportunity. If the wielder gets a hold, the staff
grabs the opponent and deals 1d10 points of damage each round the
hold is maintained.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Keen Sight " Type="Ex">
<p>Keen Sight (Ex): Kuo-toas have excellent vision thanks to
their two independently focusing eyes. Their eyesight is so keen
that they can spot a moving object or creature even if it is
invisible, ethereal, or astral. Only by remaining perfectly still
can such objects or creatures avoid their notice.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Slippery " Type="Ex">
<p>Slippery (Ex): All kuo-toas secrete an oily film that makes
them difficult to grapple or snare. Webs, magic or otherwise,
don't affect kuo-toas, and they usually can wriggle free
from most other forms of confinement.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Adhesive " Type="Ex">
<p>Adhesive (Ex): Kuo-toas use their own body oil and other
materials to give their shields a finish almost like flypaper,
holding fast any creatures or items touching them. Anyone who
makes an unsuccessful melee attack against a kuo-toa must succeed
at a Reflex save (DC 14), or the attacker's weapon sticks to
the shield and is yanked out of the wielder's grip.
Creatures using natural weapons are automatically grappled if
they get stuck.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Immunities " Type="Ex">
<p>Immunities (Ex): Kuo-toas are immune to poison and paralysis.
The various hold spells also have no effect on them, and their
keen sight automatically detects figments for what they are.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Light Blindness " Type="Ex">
<p>Light Blindness (Ex): Abrupt exposure to bright light (such as
sunlight or a daylight spell) blinds kuo-toas for 1 round. In
addition, they suffer a -1 circumstance penalty to all attack
rolls, saves, and checks while operating in bright light.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Amphibious " Type="Ex">
<p>Amphibious (Ex): Although kuo-toas breathe by means of gills,
they can survive indefinitely on land.</p>
</SpecialAbility>
</SpecialAbilities>
<Skills>
<p>Skills: Kuo-toas receive a +15 racial bonus to Escape Artist
checks and a +4 racial bonus to Spot and Search checks.</p>

<p>Mimics speak Common.</p>
</General>
<Combat>
<p>A mimic often surprises the unsuspecting adventurer, lashing
out with a heavy pseudopod. Mimics are smart enough to avoid
fights to the death by extorting treasure or food from a party.</p>
</Combat>
<SpecialAbilities>
<SpecialAbility Name="Adhesive " Type="Ex">
<p>Adhesive (Ex): A mimic exudes a thick slime that acts as a
powerful adhesive, holding fast any creatures or items touching
it. An adhesive-covered mimic automatically grapples any creature
it hits with its slam attack. Opponents so grappled cannot get
free while the mimic is alive without removing the adhesive
first. A mimic makes one automatic slam attack each round against
any creature stuck to it. A weapon that strikes an
adhesive-coated mimic is also stuck fast unless the wielder
succeeds at a Reflex save (DC 16). A successful Strength check
(DC 16) is needed to pry it off. Strong alcohol dissolves the
adhesive. A pint of wine or a similar liquid weakens it, but the
mimic still has a +4 bonus to grapple checks. A mimic can
dissolve its adhesive at will, and the substance breaks down 5
rounds after the creature dies.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Mimic Shape " Type="Ex">
<p>Mimic Shape (Ex): A mimic can assume the general shape of any
object that fills roughly 150 cubic feet (5 feet by 5 feet by 6
feet), such as a massive chest, a stout bed, or a wide door
frame. The creature cannot substantially alter its size, though.
A mimic's body is hard and has a rough texture, no matter
what appearance it might present. Anyone who examines the mimic
can detect the ruse with a successful Spot check opposed by the
mimic's Disguise check. Of course, by this time it is
generally far too late.</p>

<General>
<p>Mind flayers speak Undercommon but prefer to communicate
telepathically.</p>
</General>
<Combat>
<p>Mind flayers like to fight from a distance, using their
psionic abilities, particularly their mind blast. If pressed into
melee combat, a mind flayer lashes its enemies with the tentacles
ringing its mouth.</p>
</Combat>
<SpecialAbilities>
<SpecialAbility Name="Mind Blast " Type="Sp">
<p>Mind Blast (Sp): This attack is a cone 60 feet long. Anyone
caught in this cone must succeed at a Will save (DC 17) or be
stunned for 3d4 rounds. Mind flayers often hunt using this power
and then drag off one or two of their stunned victims to feed
upon.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Psionics " Type="Sp">
<p>Psionics (Sp): At will-astral projection, charm monster,
detect thoughts, levitate, plane shift, and suggestion. These
abilities are as the spells cast by an 8th-level sorcerer (save
DC 13 + spell level).</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Improved Grab " Type="Ex">
<p>Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, the mind flayer must
hit a Small to Large creature with its tentacle attack. If it
gets a hold, it attaches the tentacle to the opponent's
head. A mind flayer can grab a Huge or larger creature, but only
if it can somehow reach the foe's head. After a successful
grab, the mind flayer can try to attach its remaining tentacles
with a single grapple check. The opponent can escape with a
single successful grapple check or Escape Artist check, but the
mind flayer gets a +2 circumstance bonus for every tentacle that
was attached at the beginning of the opponent's turn.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Extract " Type="Ex">
<p>Extract (Ex): A mind flayer that begins its turn with all four
tentacles attached and successfully maintains its hold
automatically extracts the opponent's brain, instantly
killing that creature.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Telepathy " Type="Su">
<p>Telepathy (Su): Mind flayers can communicate telepathically
with any creature within 100 feet that has a language.</p>

self, ray of enfeeblement, and sleep. These abilities are as the

A night hag can use etherealness at will as a 16th-level sorcerer
so long as it possesses its heartstone (see below).</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Dream Haunting " Type="Su">
<p>Dream Haunting (Su): Night hags can visit the dreams of
chaotic or evil individuals by using a special periapt known as a
heartstone to become ethereal, then hovering over the creature.
Once the hag invades someone's dreams, it rides on the
victim's back until dawn. The sleeper suffers from
tormenting dreams and suffers 1 point of permanent Constitution
drain upon awakening. A sleeper reduced to a Constitution score
of 0 dies. Only another ethereal being can stop these nocturnal
intrusions, by confronting and defeating the night hag.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Immunities " Type="Ex">
<p>Immunities (Ex): Night hags are immune to fire and cold, and
to charm, sleep, and fear effects.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Heartstone " Type="Su">
<p>Heartstone (Su):  All night hags carry this periapt,
which instantly cures any disease contracted by the holder.  In
addition, a heartstone imparts a +2 resistance bonus to all saving
throws. A night hag that loses this charm can no longer use
etherealness until it can manufacture another (which takes one
month).  Good-aligned creatures can also benefit from the
heartstone's powers, but the periapt shatters after ten
uses and does not bestow etherealness.</p>

<p>Pegasus eggs are worth 2,000 gp each on the open market, while

as horses. Professional trainers charge 1,000 gp to rear or train

<p>Training a pegasus requires a successful Handle Animal check
(DC 22 for a young creature, DC 29 for an adult) and that the
creature be willing. Trainers can reduce the DC by 5 and the
training time by half by using a magic bridle enchanted for the
purpose. A pegasus can fight while carrying a rider, but the
rider cannot also attack unless he or she succeeds at a Ride
check.</p>

<SpecialAbilities>
<SpecialAbility Name="Positive Energy Lash " Type="Su">
<p>Positive Energy Lash (Su): A ravid can make a touch attack or
hit with a claw or tail slap attack to infuse a target with
positive energy. The energy produces an unpleasant tingle in
living creatures, and against undead foes (even incorporeal
ones) it deals 2d10 points of damage.</p>

<SpecialAbility Name="Animate Objects " Type="Su">
<p>Animate Objects (Su): Once per round, a random object within
20 feet of the ravid animates as though by the spell animate
objects cast by a 20th-level cleric. These objects defend the
ravid to the best of their ability, but the ravid isn't
intelligent enough to give them specific commands.</p>

</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Swallow Whole " Type="Ex">
<p>Swallow Whole (Ex): A remorhaz can try to swallow a grabbed
opponent of Large or smaller size by making a successful grapple
check. Once inside, the opponent takes 2d8+12 points of crushing
damage plus 10d10 points of fire damage per round from the
creature's blazing gut. A swallowed creature can cut its way
out by using claws or a Small or Tiny slashing weapon to deal 25
points of damage to the remorhaz's gut (AC 20). Once the
creature exits, muscular action closes the hole; another
swallowed opponent must cut its own way out. The remorhaz's

<p>A roc attacks from the air, swooping earthward to snatch prey
in its powerful talons and carry it off for itself and its young
to devour. A solitary roc is typically hunting and will attack
any Medium-size or larger creature that appears edible. A mated
pair of rocs attack in concert, fighting to the death to defend
their nests or hatchlings.</p>

<SpecialAbility Name="Snatch " Type="Ex">
<p>Snatch (Ex): A roc that hits a creature of at least Small

start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of
opportunity. If the roc achieves a hold, it can fly off with its
prey and automatically make a bite attack each round in lieu of a
claw attack. It can drop a snatched creature as a free action or
use a standard action to fling it aside. A flung creature travels
90 feet and takes 9d6 points of damage. If the roc flings it

<Combat>
<p>A roper hunts by standing very still and imitating a bit of
rock. This usually allows it to attack with surprise. When it
notices prey, it lashes out with its strands and bites adjacent
opponents with its powerful maw.</p>
</Combat>
<SpecialAbilities>
<SpecialAbility Name="Strands " Type="Ex">
<p>Strands (Ex): Most encounters with a roper begin when it fires
its strong, sticky strands. The creature has six such members
that can strike up to 50 feet away (no range increment). A single
attack with a slashing weapon that deals at least 10 points of
damage severs a strand (AC 20).</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Attach " Type="Ex">
<p>Attach (Ex): If a roper hits with a strand attack, the strand
latches onto the opponent's body. This deals no damage but
draws the stuck opponent 10 feet closer each subsequent round (no
attack of opportunity) unless that creature breaks free, which
requires a successful Escape Artist check (DC 23) or Strength
check (DC 19). The roper can draw in a creature within 10 feet of
itself and bite with a +4 attack bonus, in that round.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Weakness " Type="Ex">
<p>Weakness (Ex): A roper's strands can sap an
opponent's strength. Anyone caught by a strand must succeed
at a Fortitude save (DC 18) or take 2d8 points of temporary
Strength damage.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Fire Vulnerability " Type="Ex">
<p>Fire Vulnerability (Ex): A roper takes double damage from fire
attacks unless a save is allowed for half damage. A successful
save halves the damage and a failure doubles it.</p>

<Combat>
<p>A rust monster can scent a metal object up to 90 feet away,
dashing toward the source and attempting to strike it with its
antennae. The creature is relentless, chasing adventurers over
long distances if they still possess intact metal objects but
usually ceasing its attacks to devour a freshly rusted meal. A
clever (or desperate) adventurer can often distract a hungry rust
monster by tossing it some metal objects, then fleeing while it
consumes them.</p>

<p>The creature targets the largest metal object available,
striking first at armor, then shields and smaller items. It
prefers ferrous metals (steel or iron) over precious metals
(such as gold or silver) but will devour the latter if given the
opportunity.</p>
</Combat>
<SpecialAbilities>
<SpecialAbility Name="Rust " Type="Ex">
<p>Rust (Ex): A rust monster that makes a successful touch attack
with its antennae causes the target metal to corrode, falling to
pieces and becoming useless immediately. The size of the object
is immaterial-a full suit of armor rusts away as quickly as a
sword. Magic armor and weapons, and other enchanted items made of
metal, must succeed at a Reflex save (DC 20) or be dissolved. A
metal weapon that deals damage to a rust monster also corrodes
immediately. Wooden, stone, and other nonmetallic weapons are
unaffected.</p>

<General>
<p>About one in two hundred sahuagin has four arms. </p>
</General>
<Combat>
<p>Sahuagin mutants are savage fighters like regular
sahuagin. When swimming, a sahuagin rakes with its feet as it
strikes with its four claws or uses extra weapons. </p>

<p>Blood Frenzy: Once per day a sahuagin that takes damage in
combat can fly into a frenzy the following round, clawing and
biting madly until either it or its opponent is dead. It gains +2
Constitution and +2 Strength, and suffers a -2 AC penalty. The
sahuagin cannot end its frenzy voluntarily.</p>
</Combat>
<SpecialAbilities>
<SpecialAbility Name="Speak with Sharks " Type="Ex">
<p>Speak with Sharks (Ex): Sahuagin can communicate
telepathically with sharks up to 150 feet away. The communication
is limited to fairly simple concepts such as "food,"
"danger," and "enemy."  Sahuagin can use Animal Empathy to
befriend and train sharks.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Underwater Sense " Type="Ex">
<p>Underwater Sense (Ex): A sahuagin can locate creatures
underwater within a 30-foot radius. This ability negates the
effects of invisibility and poor visibility. It is less effective
against creatures without central nervous systems, such as
undead, oozes, and constructs; a sahuagin can locate such
creatures only within a 15-foot radius. Sahuagin are not fooled
by figments when underwater.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Light Blindness " Type="Ex">
<p>Light Blindness (Ex): Abrupt exposure to bright light (such as
sunlight or a daylight spell) blinds sahuagin for 1 round. In
addition to temporary blindness, they suffer a -1 morale penalty
to all attack rolls, saves, and checks while operating in bright
light.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Amphibious " Type="Ex">
<p>Amphibious (Ex): Sahuagin can survive out of the water for 1
hour per 2 points of Constitution.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Freshwater Sensitivity " Type="Ex">
<p>Freshwater Sensitivity (Ex): A sahuagin fully immersed in
freshwater must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 15) or leave the
water immediately. If the sahuagin fails and cannot escape, it
suffers a -4 morale penalty to all attack rolls, saves, and
checks. Even on a success, it must repeat the save attempt every
10 minutes it remains immersed.</p>
</SpecialAbility>
</SpecialAbilities>
<Skills>
<p>Skills: Sahuagin receive a +4 racial bonus to Hide, Listen,
and Spot checks. *Underwater, the bonus improves to +8. They
receive a +8 bonus to Survival and Profession (hunt)
checks within fifty miles of their homes.</p>
</Skills>
<Characters>
<p>A male sahuagin's favored class is ranger. Female
sahuagin favor the cleric class. Sahuagin clerics can choose any
two of the following domains: Evil, Law, Strength, and War.</p>

<SpecialAbilities>
<SpecialAbility Name="Pipes " Type="Su">
<p>Pipes (Su): Satyrs can play a variety of magical tunes on
their pan pipes. Usually, only one satyr in a group carries
pipes. When it plays, all creatures within a 60-foot spread
(except satyrs) must succeed at a Will save (DC 14) or be
affected by charm person, sleep, or fear, as the spells cast by a
10th-level sorcerer (the satyr chooses the tune and its effect).
In the hands of other beings, these pipes have no special powers.
A creature that successfully saves against any of the pipe's
effects cannot be affected by the same set of pipes again for one
day. A satyr often uses its pipes to charm and seduce especially
comely women or to put a party of adventurers to sleep and then
steal their valuables.</p>

<Description>
<General>
<p>A shield guardian when fashioned is keyed to a particular
amulet. Henceforth, it regards the wearer of that amulet to be
its master, protecting and following that person everywhere
(unless specifically commanded not to do so).</p>
</General>
<SpecialAbilities>
<SpecialAbility Name="Spell Storing " Type="Sp">
<p>Spell Storing (Sp): The shield guardian can store one spell of
4th level or lower that is cast into it by another creature. It
"casts" this spell when commanded or when a
predetermined situation arises. Once this is used, it can store
another spell (or the same spell).</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Construct" Type="Ex">
<p>Construct: Immune to mind-influencing effects, poison,
disease, and similar effects. Not subject to critical hits,
subdual damage, ability damage, energy drain, or death from
massive damage.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Shield Other " Type="Sp">
<p>Shield Other (Sp): The wearer of the keyed amulet can activate
this defensive ability if within 100 feet of the shield guardian.
Just as the spell of the same name, this transfers to the
guardian half the damage that would be dealt to the amulet wearer
(this ability does not provide the spell's AC or save
bonuses, but see below).</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Guard " Type="Ex">
<p>Guard (Ex): The shield guardian moves swiftly to defend the
amulet wearer by its side, blocking blows and disrupting foes.
All attacks against the amulet wearer suffer a -2 deflection
penalty.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Find Master " Type="Su">
<p>Find Master (Su): No matter the distance, as long as they are
on the same plane, the shield guardian can find the amulet wearer
(or just the amulet, if it is removed after the guardian is
called).</p>
</SpecialAbility>
</SpecialAbilities>
<Construction>
<p>A shield guardian costs 100,000 gp to create. This cost
includes the construct's physical body, the keyed amulet,
and all the materials and spell components that are consumed or
become a permanent part of them. This cost includes 1,000 gp for
the body and 500 gp for the amulet.</p>

<p>Creating the body requires a successful Profession
(engineering) or Craft (sculpture) check (DC 16).</p>

<p>The second requirement is creating the keyed amulet from
bronze, which requires a successful Craft (metalworking) check
(DC 12).</p>

<p>After the body and amulet are fashioned, the creature must be
animated through an extended magical ritual that requires a week
to complete. Understanding the ritual requires a 12th-level
character with the Craft Wondrous Item feat. The creator must
labor for at least 8 hours each day in a specially prepared
laboratory or workroom. The chamber is similar to both an
alchemist's laboratory and a smithy and costs 1,000 gp to
establish.</p>

<p>When not working on the ritual, the character must rest and
can perform no other activities except eating, sleeping, or
talking. If personally constructing the creature's body, the
creator can perform the building and ritual together. If the
creator misses a day of the ritual, the process fails and must be
started again. Money spent is lost, but XP spent are not. The
shield guardian's body can be reused, as can the chamber.</p>

<p>Completing the ritual drains 2,000 XP from the creator and
requires limited wish, locate object, make whole, shield, and
shield other, which must be cast on the final day of the ritual.
The creator must cast the spells personally, but they can come
from outside sources, such as scrolls.</p>

<p><strong>Amulet</strong></p>

<p>If the keyed amulet is destroyed, the guardian ceases to
function until a new one is created. If the wearer dies but the
amulet is intact, the shield guardian carries out the last
command given.</p>

<p>A shocker lizard relies on its electrical abilities in combat.
A lizard tends to bite only after its shock has rendered an
opponent unconscious or when the shock seems to have no effect at
all. Lone lizards flee once they deliver their shocks, but if
others are nearby, they all home in on their comrade's
discharges and administer deadly shocks to the foe.</p>

<p>A spider eater attacks with its venomous sting and powerful
mandibles. Its usual tactic is to deliver a sting, then back off,
hovering out of reach until the venom takes effect. Spider eaters
do not like to give up their prey, and foes who harry them with
spells or ranged attacks provoke a determined counterattack.</p>
</Combat>

<SpecialAbility Name="Freedom of Movement " Type="Su">
<p>Freedom of Movement (Su): Spider eaters have freedom of
movement as though from the spell cast by a 12th-level sorcerer.
The effect can be dispelled, but the spider eater can create it
again the next round as a free action. When the spider eater
serves as a mount, this effect does not extend to its rider.</p>
</SpecialAbility>
</SpecialAbilities>
<Skills>
<p>Skills: Spider eaters receive a +4 racial bonus to Listen and
Spot checks.</p>
</Skills>
<Training>
<p>Training a spider eater as an aerial mount requires a
successful Handle Animal check (DC 24 for a young creature, or DC
29 for an adult). A spider eater matures in six months.</p>

<p>Spider eater eggs are worth 2,000 gp apiece on the open
market, while young are worth 3,000 gp each. Professional
trainers charge 3,000 gp to rear or train a spider eater. Riding
a trained spider eater requires an exotic saddle. A spider eater
can fight while carrying a rider, but the rider cannot also
attack unless he or she succeeds at a Ride check.</p>
</Training>
<CarryingCapacity>
<p>Carrying Capacity: A light load for a spider eater is up to
612 pounds; a medium load, 613-1,224 pounds; and a heavy load,

<p>Frightful Presence (Su): The tarrasque can inspire terror by
charging or attacking. Affected creatures must succeed at a Will
save (DC 26) or become shaken, remaining shaken until they leave
the area of effect.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Rush " Type="Ex">
<p>Rush (Ex): Once per minute, the normally slow-moving tarrasque
can move at a speed of 150 feet.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Improved Grab " Type="Ex">
<p>Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, the tarrasque must
hit a Huge or smaller opponent with its bite attack. If it gets a
hold, it can try to swallow the foe.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Swallow Whole " Type="Ex">
<p>Swallow Whole (Ex): The tarrasque can try to swallow a grabbed
opponent of Huge or smaller size by making a successful grapple
check. Once inside, the opponent takes 2d8+8 points of crushing
damage plus 2d8+6 points of acid damage per round from the
tarrasque's digestive juices. A swallowed creature can cut
its way out by dealing 50 points of damage to the
tarrasque's digestive tract (AC 20). Once the creature
exits, muscular action closes the hole; another swallowed
opponent must cut its own way out. The tarrasque's gullet
can hold two Huge, four Large, eight Medium-size, or sixteen
Small or smaller creatures.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Augmented Criticals " Type="Ex">
<p>Augmented Criticals (Ex): The tarrasque threatens a critical

successful critical hit.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Carapace " Type="Ex">
<p>Carapace (Ex): The tarrasque's armorlike carapace is
exceptionally tough and highly reflective, deflecting all rays,
lines, cones, and even magic missile spells. There is a 30%
chance of reflecting any such effect back at the caster;
otherwise, it is merely negated. Check for reflection before
rolling to overcome the creature's spell resistance.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Immunities " Type="Ex">
<p>Immunities (Ex): The tarrasque has fire, poison, and disease
immunity.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Regeneration " Type="Ex">
<p>Regeneration (Ex): No form of attack deals normal damage to
the tarrasque. The tarrasque regenerates even if disintegrated or
slain with death magic: These attack forms merely reduce it to
-10 hit points. It is immune to effects that produce incurable or
bleeding wounds, such as a sword of wounding, mummy rot, or a
clay golem's wound ability. The tarrasque can be permanently
slain only by reducing it to -30 hit points and using a wish or
miracle spell to keep it dead. If the tarrasque loses a limb or
body part, the lost portion regrows in 1d6 minutes (the detached
piece dies and decays normally). The creature can reattach the
severed member instantly by holding it to the stump.</p>

<SpecialAbility Name="Improved Grab " Type="Ex">
<p>Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, the tendriculos must
hit with its bite attack. If it gets a hold, it automatically
deals bite damage and can try to swallow the opponent. A
tendriculos that hits with a tendril attack grabs as above. If it
gets a hold, it picks up the opponent and transfers it to the
mouth as a partial action, automatically dealing bite damage as
above.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Swallow Whole/Paralysis " Type="Ex">
<p>Swallow Whole/Paralysis (Ex): A tendriculos can try to swallow
a grabbed opponent of Large or smaller size by making a
successful grapple check. Once inside the plant's mass, the
opponent must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 19) or be paralyzed
for 3d6 rounds by the tendriculos's digestive juices, taking
2d6 points of acid damage per round. A new save is required each
round inside the plant. A swallowed creature that avoids
paralysis can climb out of the mass with a successful grapple
check. This returns it to the plant's maw, where another
successful grapple check is needed to get free. A swallowed
creature can also cut its way out by using claws or a Small or
Tiny slashing weapon to deal 25 points of damage to the
tendriculos's interior (AC 15). Once the creature exits, the
plant's amazing regenerative capacity closes the hole;
another swallowed opponent must again cut its own way out. The
tendriculos's interior can hold two Large, four Small, eight
Tiny, sixteen Diminutive, or thirty-two Fine or smaller
opponents.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Plant" Type="Ex">
<p>Plant: Immune to mind-influencing effects, poison, sleep,
paralysis, stunning, and polymorphing. Not subject to critical
hits.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Regeneration " Type="Ex">
<p>Regeneration (Ex): Bludgeoning weapons and acid deal normal
damage to a tendriculos. A tendriculos that loses part of its
body mass can regrow it in 1d6 minutes. Holding the severed
portion against the mass enables it to reattach instantly.</p>

<SpecialAbility Name="Slaying " Type="Ex">
<p>Slaying (Ex): Vampire spawn are equally vulnerable to
attacks which slay vampires.  Exposing a vampire spawn to direct
sunlight disorients it: It can take only partial actions and is
destroyed utterly on the next round if it cannot escape.  Similarly,
immersing a vampire spawn in running water robs it of one-third of
its hit points each round until it is destroyed at the end of the
third round. </p>

<p>Skills: Vampire spawn receive a +4 racial bonus to Bluff,

<SpecialAbility Name="Shriek " Type="Su">
<p>Shriek (Su): Instead of biting, a vargouille can open its
distended mouth and let out a terrible shriek. Those within 60
feet (except other vargouilles) who both hear the shriek and can
clearly see the creature must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 12)
or be paralyzed with fear until the monster attacks them, goes
out of range, or leaves their sight. A paralyzed creature is
susceptible to the vargouille's kiss. If the save is
successful, that opponent cannot be affected again by that
vargouille's shriek for one day.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Poison " Type="Ex">
<p>Poison (Ex): Bite, Fortitude save (DC 12) or be unable to heal
the bite damage naturally or magically. A neutralize poison or
heal spell removes the effect, while delay poison allows magical
healing.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Kiss " Type="Su">
<p>Kiss (Su): A vargouille can kiss a paralyzed target with a
successful melee touch attack, beginning a terrible
transformation. The affected opponent must succeed at a Fortitude
save (DC 19) or begin to transform, losing all his or her hair
1d6 hours later. After another 1d6 hours, the ears grow into
leathery wings, tentacles sprout on the chin and scalp, and the
teeth become long, pointed fangs. During the next 1d6 hours, the
victim suffers 1d6 points of permanent Intelligence and Charisma
drain. The transformation is complete 1d6 hours later, when the
head breaks free of the body (which promptly dies) and becomes a
vargouille. This transformation is interrupted by sunlight, and
even a daylight spell can delay death, but to reverse the
transformation requires remove disease.</p>

<General/>
<Combat>
<p>Xills are dangerous opponents, attacking with all four limbs
at no penalty. More civilized ones use weapons, usually fighting
with two at a time so as to leave two claws free for grab
attacks.</p>

<p>Xills typically lie in wait on the Ethereal Plane for suitable
prey to happen by, then ambush it using their planewalk ability.
They make full use of their Tumble skill in combat: Usually, one
or two distract physically powerful enemies by attacking, then
assuming a defensive stance while their fellows maneuver to
advantage.</p>

<p>Xills seldom destroy enemies in combat but take prisoners
whenever they can, dragging them back to the Ethereal Plane and
implanting them with eggs.</p>
</Combat>
<SpecialAbilities>
<SpecialAbility Name="Improved Grab " Type="Ex">
<p>Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, the xill must hit
with one or more claw attacks. The grapple check has a +2 bonus
for each claw that hits. If it gets a hold and maintains it the
next round, it automatically bites the foe at that time. The bite
deals no damage but injects a paralyzing venom.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Paralysis " Type="Ex">
<p>Paralysis (Ex): Those bitten by a xill must succeed at a
Fortitude save (DC 14) or be paralyzed for 1d4 hours. Barbaric
xills secrete enough venom to bite two opponents every 6 hours,
while their civilized cousins can bite only once per day.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Planewalk " Type="Su">
<p>Planewalk (Su): These planar travelers like to slip between
the folds of space to attack enemies as though from thin air.
They can cross from the Ethereal Plane with a move action but
take 2 rounds to cross back, during which time they are immobile.
As a xill fades away, it becomes harder to hit: Opponents suffer
a 20% miss chance on the first round and a 50% miss chance on the
second.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Implant " Type="Ex">
<p>Implant (Ex): Xills lay their eggs inside paralyzed creatures.
The young emerge about 90 days later, literally devouring the
host from inside. A remove disease spell rids a victim of the
egg, as does a successful Heal check (DC 20) by someone with that
skill. If the check fails, the healer can try again, but each
attempt (successful or not) deals 1d4 points of damage to the
patient.</p>
</SpecialAbility>
</SpecialAbilities>
<!--Feats>
<p>Feats: A xill receives the Multiweapon Fighting feat as a
bonus feat. With its Multidexterity [removed, not srd] and Multiweapon Fighting
feats, it can attack with all its arms at no penalty as a racial
ability.</p>
</Feats-->
<Characters>
<p>Xill clerics can choose any two of the following domains:
Evil, Law, Strength, and Travel.</p>

<Description>
<General>
<p>Despite their intelligence, yrthaks do not speak.</p>
</General>
<Combat>
<p>An yrthak prefers to attack from the air, strafing the ground
with sonic attacks or snatching up and dropping prey (eventually
landing to devour the flattened mess).</p>
</Combat>
<SpecialAbilities>
<SpecialAbility Name="Sonic Lance " Type="Su">
<p>Sonic Lance (Su): Every 2 rounds, an yrthak can focus sonic
energy in a ray up to 60 feet long. This is a ranged touch attack
that deals 6d6 points of damage to a single target.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Explosion " Type="Su">
<p>Explosion (Su): The yrthak can fire its sonic lance at the
ground, a large rock, a stone wall, or the like to create an
explosion of shattered stone. This attack deals 2d6 points of
piercing damage to all within 10 feet of the effect's
center. This counts as a use of the sonic lance and thus is
usable only once every 2 rounds, and never on a round following a
sonic lance attack.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Snatch " Type="Ex">
<p>Snatch (Ex): An yrthak that hits a Medium-size or smaller
creature with a claw attack attempts to start a grapple as a free
action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it gets a
hold, it can fly off with its prey and deal automatic claw
damage, though it prefers to drop victims from a height. It can
drop a snatched creature as a free action, which deals normal
falling damage if the yrthak is flying.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Blindsight " Type="Ex">
<p>Blindsight (Ex): An yrthak can ascertain all foes within 120
feet. Beyond that range it is considered blinded. Yrthaks are
invulnerable to gaze attacks, visual effects of spells such as
illusions, and other attack forms that rely on sight.
An yrthak whose sense of hearing is impaired is effectively
blind, treating all targets as totally concealed.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Sonic Vulnerability " Type="Ex">
<p>Sonic Vulnerability (Ex): Yrthaks are affected by loud noises
and sonic spells (such as ghost sound or silence) and are more
susceptible to sound-based attacks, suffering a -2 racial penalty
to all saves.</p>
</SpecialAbility>
</SpecialAbilities>
<Skills>
<p>Skills: Yrthaks receive a +4 racial bonus to Listen checks.</p>

<p>Web (Ex): Escape DC 16, Break DC 22, Hit Points 2.
</p>
<p>Both types of monstrous spiders often wait in their
webs or in trees, then lower themselves silently on silk strands
and leap onto prey passing beneath. A single strand is strong
enough to support the spider and one creature of the same size.
Web-spinning spiders can cast a web eight times per day. This
is similar to an attack with a net but has a maximum range of 50
feet, with a range increment of 10 feet, and is effective against
targets up to one size smaller that the spider. The web anchors
the target in place, allowing no movement. An entangled creature
can escape with a successful Escape Artist check or burst it with
a Strength check. Both are standard actions whose DCs are given in
the description for each size. Web-spinning spiders often create
sheets of sticky webbing from 5 to 60 feet square, depending on
the size of the spider. They usually position these sheets to
snare flying creatures but can also try to trap prey on the
ground. Approaching creatures must succeed at a Spot check (DC
20) to notice a web; otherwise they stumble into it and become
trapped as though by a successful web attack. Attempts to escape
or burst the webbing gain a +5 bonus if the trapped creature has
something to walk on or grab while pulling free. Each 5-foot
section has the hit points given in the description for each size,
and sheet webs have damage reduction 5/fire. A monstrous spider
can move across its own sheet web at its climb speed and can
determine the exact location of any creature touching the web.</p>

<Combat>
<p>An animated object's abilities vary depending on its form.
It always has the construct qualities, and can have one or more of the
following special abilities.</p>
</Combat>
<SpecialAbilities>
<SpecialAbility Name="Construct" Type="Ex">
<p>Construct: Immune to mind-influencing effects, poison,
disease, and similar effects. Not subject to critical hits,
subdual damage, ability damage, energy drain, or death from
massive damage.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Blind " Type="Ex">
<p>Blind (Ex): A sheetlike animated object such as a carpet or
tapestry can grapple an opponent up to three sizes larger. The
object makes a normal grapple check. If it gets a hold, it wraps
itself around the opponent's head, blinding that creature
until removed. The blinded creature cannot make Spot, Search, or
Track checks and suffers a -6 circumstance penalty to other
checks related to perception, such as Listen.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Constrict " Type="Ex">
<p>Constrict (Ex): A flexible animated object such as a rope,
vine, or rug deals automatic slam damage with a successful
grapple check against creatures up to one size larger than
itself. An object of at least Large size can make constrict
attacks against multiple creatures at once, if they all are at
least two sizes smaller than the object and fit under it.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Trample " Type="Ex">
<p>Trample (Ex): An animated object of at least Large size and
with a hardness of at least 10 can trample creatures two or more
sizes smaller for the object's slam damage. Opponents who do
not make attacks of opportunity against the object can attempt
Reflex saves (DC 10 + 1/2 object's HD) to halve the damage.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Hardness " Type="Ex">
<p>Hardness (Ex): An animated object has the same hardness it had
before it was animated.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Improved Speed " Type="Ex">
<p>Improved Speed (Ex): The base speeds given in the statistics
block assume that animated objects lurch, rock, or slither along.
Objects with two legs (statues, ladders) or a similar shape that
allows faster movement have a speed bonus of 10 feet. Objects
with multiple legs (tables, chairs) have a speed bonus of 20
feet. Wheeled objects gain a speed bonus of 40 feet. Objects
might have additional modes of movement. A wooden object can
float and has a swim speed equal to half its land speed. A rope
or similar sinuous object has a climb speed equal to half its
land speed. A sheetlike object can fly (clumsy maneuverability)
at half its normal speed.</p>

<Description>
<General>
<p>Barghests speak Goblin, Worg, and Infernal.</p>
</General>
<Combat>
<p>Barghests can claw and bite, no matter what their form, and
usually disdain weapons. Though they love killing, they have
little stomach for direct combat and attack from ambush whenever
possible. Once battle is joined, barghests hide and use project
image to conceal their true numbers and locations, with emotion
and charm person to keep opponents off balance. They try to pit
as many of themselves against as few of the enemy as possible,
and use their high speed to stay way from the enemy's main
strength.</p>
</Combat>
<SpecialAbilities>
<SpecialAbility Name="Spell-Like Abilities" Type="Ex">
<p>Spell-Like Abilities: At will-levitate, misdirection, and
project image; 1/day-charm monster, charm person, dimension door,
and emotion. These abilities are as the spells cast by a sorcerer
whose level equals the barghest's HD (save DC 12 + spell
level).</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Feed " Type="Su">
<p>Feed (Su): When a barghest slays a humanoid opponent, it
can feed on the corpse, devouring both flesh and life force, as a
full-round action. For every 8 HD or levels a barghest consumes,
it gains 1 Hit Die. Feeding destroys the victim's body and
prevents any form of raising or resurrection that requires part
of the corpse. A wish, miracle, or true resurrection spell can
restore a devoured victim to life, but there is a 50% chance that
even such powerful magic will fail.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Alternate Form " Type="Su">
<p>Alternate Form (Su): A barghest can assume the form of a
goblin or a large wolf as a standard action. This ability is
similar to the polymorph self spell, except that it allows only
goblin and wolf forms.  *While in wolf form, a barghest gains
the higher of the two listed speeds and a +4 circumstance bonus
to Hide checks.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Pass Without Trace " Type="Ex">
<p>Pass Without Trace (Ex): A barghest in wolf form can pass
without trace (as the spell) as a free action.</p>

<Description>
<General>
<p>Barghests speak Goblin, Worg, and Infernal.</p>
</General>
<Combat>
<p>Barghests can claw and bite, no matter what their form, and
usually disdain weapons. Though they love killing, they have
little stomach for direct combat and attack from ambush whenever
possible. Once battle is joined, barghests hide and use project
image to conceal their true numbers and locations, with emotion
and charm person to keep opponents off balance. They try to pit
as many of themselves against as few of the enemy as possible,
and use their high speed to stay way from the enemy's main
strength.</p>

<p>Occasionally, a greater barghest uses a magic two-handed
weapon in combat, giving it multiple attacks (attack bonus
+13/+8). It can also make one bite attack (attack bonus +8) each
round. The save DC against a greater barghest's spell-like
abilities is 14 + spell level.</p>
</Combat>
<SpecialAbilities>
<SpecialAbility Name="Spell-Like Abilities" Type="Ex">
<p>Spell-Like Abilities: At will-levitate, misdirection, and
project image; 1/day-charm monster, charm person, dimension door,
and emotion. These abilities are as the spells cast by a sorcerer
whose level equals the barghest's HD (save DC 12 + spell
level).</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Feed " Type="Su">
<p>Feed (Su): When a barghest slays a humanoid opponent, it can
feed on the corpse, devouring both flesh and life force, as a
full-round action. For every 8 HD or levels a barghest consumes,
it gains 1 Hit Die. Feeding destroys the victim's body and
prevents any form of raising or resurrection that requires part
of the corpse. A wish, miracle, or true resurrection spell can
restore a devoured victim to life, but there is a 50% chance that
even such powerful magic will fail.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Alternate Form " Type="Su">
<p>Alternate Form (Su): A barghest can assume the form of a
goblin or a large wolf as a standard action. This ability is
similar to the polymorph self spell, except that it allows only
goblin and wolf forms.  *While in wolf form, a barghest gains the
higher of the two listed speeds and a +4 circumstance bonus to
Hide checks.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Pass Without Trace " Type="Ex">
<p>Pass Without Trace (Ex): A barghest in wolf form can pass
without trace (as the spell) as a free action.</p>

<Description>
<General>
<p>Bebiliths do not speak but understand Abyssal. Their telepathy
allows them to communicate silently with one another.</p>
</General>
<SpecialAbilities>
<SpecialAbility Name="Web " Type="Ex">
<p>Web (Ex): Four times per day a bebilith can shoot webs from
its abdomen. This attack is like a web spell, with a few
exceptions. The range is 30 feet, and the webs are permanent,
nonmagical, and cannot be dispelled. The DC for evading or
breaking free from the webs is 20, and there is a 75% chance that
the webbing won't burn if any sort of fire is applied to it
(check each round).</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Poison " Type="Ex">
<p>Poison (Ex): Bite, Fortitude save (DC 20); initial damage 1d6
temporary Constitution, secondary damage 2d6 temporary
Constitution. Bebilith venom is highly perishable, losing its
potency and becoming inert, foul-smelling goo almost as soon as
it comes into contact with air.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Armor Damage " Type="Ex">
<p>Armor Damage (Ex): A bebilith's claws can catch and tear
an opponent's armor. If the opponent has both armor and a
shield, roll 1d6: A roll of 1-4 affects the armor and a roll of
5-6 affects the shield. Make a grapple check whenever the
bebilith hits with a claw attack, adding to the opponent's
roll any magical bonus for the armor or shield. If the bebilith
wins, the affected armor or shield is torn away and ruined.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Protective Aura " Type="Su">
<p>Protective Aura (Su): A magic circle against chaos, evil,
good, or law effect always surrounds a bebilith, identical with
the spell cast by a 12th-level sorcerer. The bebilith usually
chooses magic circle against chaos but can change the aura each
round as a free action. The aura can be dispelled, but the
bebilith can create it again during its next turn as a free
action. (The defensive benefits from the aura are not included in
the creature's statistics.)</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Plane Shift " Type="Su">
<p>Plane Shift (Su): This ability affects only the bebilith. It
is otherwise similar to the spell of the same name.</p>
</SpecialAbility>
</SpecialAbilities>
<Skills>
<p>Skills: The bebilith's mottled coloration gives it a +8
racial bonus to Hide checks.</p>

</General>
<SpecialAbilities>
<SpecialAbility Name="Eye Rays " Type="Su">
<p>Eye Rays (Su): A retriever's eyes can produce four
different magical rays with a range of 100 feet. Each round, it
can fire two rays, but an individual ray is usable only once
every 6 rounds. It cannot fire rays in the same round as it makes
physical attacks.  Each effect follows the rules for a ray.
Save DC is 16. The four eye effects are:
<ul>
<li>Fire: Deals 12d6 fire damage to the target and to all
those within 5 feet (those nearby are allowed Reflex
saves to halve the damage).</li>
<li>Cold: Deals 12d6 cold damage to the target.</li>
<li>Electricity: Deals 12d6 electricity damage to the target.</li>
<li>Petrification: The target must succeed at a Fortitude
save or turn to stone permanently.</li>
</ul>
</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Improved Grab " Type="Ex">
<p>Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, the retriever must
hit with its bite attack. If it gets a hold, it holds the
opponent fast in its mouth. This is how it usually
"retrieves" things.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Find Target " Type="Sp">
<p>Find Target (Sp): When ordered to find an item or being, a
retriever does so unerringly, as though guided by discern
location.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Construct" Type="Ex">
<p>Construct: Immune to mind-influencing effects, poison,
disease, and similar effects. Not subject to critical hits,
subdual damage, ability damage, energy drain, or death from
massive damage.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Regeneration " Type="Ex">
<p>Regeneration (Ex): Blessed and holy weapons deal normal damage
to retrievers.
</p>
<p>A retriever that loses a limb or body part can reattach it by
holding the severed member to the stump. Reattachment takes 1 minute.
A retriever regrows lost body parts in one day (lost parts become
inert).</p>

These abilities are as the spells cast by a 12th-level sorcerer
(save DC 11 + spell level).</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Spores " Type="Ex">
<p>Spores (Ex): A vrock can release masses of spores from its
body once every 3 rounds. The spores automatically deal 1d8
points of damage to all creatures within 5 feet of the vrock.
They then penetrate the skin and grow, dealing an additional 1d2
points of damage each round for 10 rounds. At the end of this
time, the victim is covered with a tangle of viny growths. A
delay poison spell stops the spores' growth for its
duration. Bless, neutralize poison, or remove disease kills the
spores, as does sprinkling the victim with a vial of holy water.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Stunning Screech " Type="Su">
<p>Stunning Screech (Su): Once per hour a vrock can emit a
piercing screech. Every creature within a 30-foot radius must
succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 17) or be stunned for 1 round.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Dance of Ruin " Type="Su">
<p>Dance of Ruin (Su): To use this ability, a group of five or
more vrocks join hands in a circle, dancing wildly and chanting.
If they dance for 3 rounds, a wave of crackling energy flashes
outward in a 100-foot radius. All nondemon creatures within the
radius take 2d20 points of damage (Reflex half DC 15). Forcing
the vrocks to break the circle stops the dance.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Summon Tanar'ri " Type="Sp">
<p>Summon Tanar'ri (Sp): Once per day a vrock can attempt to
summon 2d10 dretches or another vrock with a 35% chance of
success.  This is much as though casting a summon monster spell.
Summoned creatures automatically return whence they came after 1 hour.
A tanar'ri that has just been summoned cannot use its own
summon ability for 1 hour.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Immunities " Type="Ex">

<SpecialAbility Name="Stench " Type="Ex">
<p>Stench (Ex): A hezrou's skin produces a foul-smelling,
toxic liquid whenever it fights. All creatures (except other
tanar'ri) within 10 feet must succeed at a Fortitude save
(DC 17) or be overwhelmed by nausea. They are rendered helpless
from gagging and vomiting for as long as they remain in the
affected area and for 1d4 rounds afterward. Creatures who
successfully save suffer a -2 morale penalty to attack rolls but
cannot be affected again by the same hezrou's stench for one

from one creature.</p>

attack with a net. The whip has a maximum range of 40 feet, with
a range increment of 10 feet, and 20 hit points. The whip needs
no folding. If it hits, the target and the balor immediately make
opposed Strength checks; if the balor wins, it drags the target

the spell cast by a 20th-level sorcerer.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Summon Tanar'ri " Type="Sp">
<p>Summon Tanar'ri (Sp): Once per day a balor can
automatically summon 4d10 dretches, 1d4 hezrous, or one
nalfeshnee, glabrezu, marilith, or balor.  This is much as though
casting a summon monster spell.  Summoned creatures automatically
return whence they came after 1 hour.  A tanar'ri that has just
been summoned cannot use its own summon ability for 1 hour. </p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Death Throes " Type="Ex">

<p>Barbazu speak Infernal, Celestial, and Draconic.</p>
</General>
<SpecialAbilities>
<SpecialAbility Name="Spell-Like Abilities" Type="Ex">
<p>Spell-Like Abilities: At will: animate dead, charm person,
command, desecrate, magic weapon, major image, produce flame, and
suggestion. Barbazu also can induce fear by touch as the spell,
except it affects only the creature touched. These abilities are
as cast by an 8th-level sorcerer (save DC 10 + spell level).
A barbazu can teleport without error (self plus 50 pounds of
objects only) at will as the spell cast by a 12th-level sorcerer.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Wound " Type="Su">
<p>Wound (Su): A hit from a barbazu's glaive causes a
bleeding wound. The injured creature loses 2 additional hit
points each round until the wound is bound (a DC 10 Heal check)
or the creature dies. This is an ability of the barbazu, not of
the weapon.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Beard " Type="Ex">
<p>Beard (Ex): If a barbazu hits a single opponent with both claw
attacks, it automatically hits with its beard. The affected
creature must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 14) or be infected
with a vile disease called devil chills (incubation period 1d4
days, damage 1d4 points of temporary Strength). Damage is dealt
each day until the afflicted creature succeeds at three
consecutive Fortitude saves, the disease is cured magically, or
the creature dies. The beard also causes 1d8+2 damage.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Battle Frenzy " Type="Ex">
<p>Battle Frenzy (Ex): A barbazu can work itself into a battle
frenzy similar to the barbarian's rage ability (+4 Strength,
+4 Constitution, +2 morale bonus to Will saves, -2 AC penalty),
for a +2 morale bonus to attacks and damage and 12 extra hit
points. The frenzy lasts 6 rounds, and the barbazu suffers no ill
effects afterward.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Summon Baatezu " Type="Sp">
<p>Summon Baatezu (Sp): Once per day a barbazu can attempt to
summon 2d10 lemures with a 50% chance of success, or another
barbazu with a 35% chance of success.  This is much as though
casting a summon monster spell. Summoned creatures automatically
return whence they came after 1 hour. A baatezu that has just been
summoned cannot use its own summon ability for 1 hour.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Immunities " Type="Ex">

<General>
<p>Pit fiends speak Infernal, Celestial, and Draconic.</p>
</General>
<SpecialAbilities>
<SpecialAbility Name="Spell-Like Abilities" Type="Ex">
<p>Spell-Like Abilities: At will: animate dead, blasphemy, charm
person, create undead, desecrate, detect good, detect magic,
dispel magic, fireball, hold person, improved invisibility, magic
circle against good, major image, produce flame, polymorph self,
pyrotechnics, suggestion, teleport without error (self plus 50
pounds of objects only), unholy aura, unhallow, and wall of fire;
1/day-meteor swarm (any) and symbol (any). These abilities are as
the spells cast by a 17th-level sorcerer (save DC 13 + spell level).
</p>
<p>Once per year a pit fiend can use wish as the spell cast by a
20th-level sorcerer.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Fear Aura " Type="Su">
<p>Fear Aura (Su): As a free action, a pit fiend can create an
aura of fear in a 20-foot radius. It is otherwise identical with
fear cast by a 15th-level sorcerer (save DC 19). If the save is
successful, that creature cannot be affected again by that pit
fiend's fear aura for one day. Other baatezu are immune to
the aura.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Poison " Type="Ex">
<p>Poison (Ex): Bite, Fortitude save (DC 21); initial damage 1d6
temporary Constitution, secondary damage death.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Disease " Type="Su">
<p>Disease (Su): Even if an affected creature saves against the
poison, it must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 14) or be
infected with a vile disease called devil chills (incubation
period 1d4 days, damage 1d4 points of temporary Strength). </p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Improved Grab " Type="Ex">
<p>Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, the pit fiend must
hit a Medium-size or smaller opponent with its tail slap attack.
If it gets a hold, it can constrict.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Constrict " Type="Ex">
<p>Constrict (Ex): A pit fiend deals 2d4+10 points of damage with
a successful grapple check against Medium-size or smaller
creatures.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Summon Baatezu " Type="Sp">
<p>Summon Baatezu (Sp): Twice per day a pit fiend can
automatically summon two lemures, osyluths, or barbazu, or one
erinyes, cornugon, or gelugon.  This is much as though
casting a summon monster spell. Summoned creatures automatically
return whence they came after 1 hour. A baatezu that has just been
summoned cannot use its own summon ability for 1 hour.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Regeneration " Type="Ex">
<p>Regeneration (Ex): Pit fiends take normal damage from holy and
blessed weapons of at least +3 enchantment.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Immunities " Type="Ex">
<p>Immunities (Ex): Baatezu are immune to fire and poison.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="See in Darkness " Type="Su">
<p>See in Darkness (Su): All devils can see perfectly in darkness
of any kind, even that created by deeper darkness spells.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Telepathy " Type="Su">
<p>Telepathy (Su): Baatezu can communicate telepathically with
any creature within 100 feet that has a language.</p>

<SpecialAbility Name="Air Mastery " Type="Ex">
<p>Air Mastery (Ex): Airborne creatures suffer a -1 penalty to
attack and damage rolls against an air elemental.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Whirlwind " Type="Su">
<p>Whirlwind (Su): The elemental can transform itself into a
whirlwind once every 10 minutes and remain in that form for up to
1 round for every 2 HD it has. In this form, the elemental can
move through the air or along a surface at its fly speed.
The whirlwind is DC 11, damage 1d4, and height up to 20 feet.
</p>
<p>The whirlwind is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 30 feet wide
at the top, and up to 50 feet tall, depending on the
elemental's size. The elemental controls the exact height,
but it must be at least 10 feet.
</p>
<p>Creatures one or more sizes smaller than the elemental might
take damage when caught in the whirlwind (see the following table
for details) and may be lifted into the air. An affected creature
must succeed at a Reflex save when it comes into contact with the
whirlwind or take the listed damage. It must also succeed at a
second Reflex save or be picked up bodily and held suspended in
the powerful winds, automatically taking the listed damage each
round. A creature that can fly is allowed a Reflex save each
round to escape the whirlwind. The creature still takes damage
but can leave if the save is successful. The DC for saves against
the whirlwind's effects varies with the elemental's size.
</p>
<p>The elemental can eject any carried creatures whenever it
wishes, depositing them wherever the whirlwind happens to be. A
summoned elemental always ejects trapped creatures before
returning to its home plane.
</p>
<p>If the whirlwind's base touches the ground, it creates a
swirling cloud of debris. This cloud is centered on the elemental
and has a diameter equal to half the whirlwind's height. The
cloud obscures all vision, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet.
Creatures 5 feet away have one-half concealment, while those
farther away have total concealment. Those caught in the cloud
must succeed at a Concentration check to cast a spell (DC equal
to the Reflex save DC).</p>

<p>An elder air elemental is 40 feet high and weighs 12 lbs.</p>

<p>Air elementals speak Auran, although they rarely choose to
do so.  Their voices sound like the high-pitched screech of a tornado
or the low moan of a midnight storm.</p>
</General>
<SpecialAbilities>
<SpecialAbility Name="Elemental" Type="Ex">
<p>Elemental: Immune to poison, sleep, paralysis, and stunning.
Not subject to critical hits.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Air Mastery " Type="Ex">
<p>Air Mastery (Ex): Airborne creatures suffer a -1 penalty to
attack and damage rolls against an air elemental.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Whirlwind " Type="Su">
<p>Whirlwind (Su): The elemental can transform itself into a
whirlwind once every 10 minutes and remain in that form for up to
1 round for every 2 HD it has. In this form, the elemental can
move through the air or along a surface at its fly speed.
The whirlwind is DC 27, damage 2d8, and height 10-60 feet.
</p>
<p>The whirlwind is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 30 feet wide
at the top, and up to 50 feet tall, depending on the
elemental's size. The elemental controls the exact height,
but it must be at least 10 feet.
</p>
<p>Creatures one or more sizes smaller than the elemental might
take damage when caught in the whirlwind (see the following table
for details) and may be lifted into the air. An affected creature
must succeed at a Reflex save when it comes into contact with the
whirlwind or take the listed damage. It must also succeed at a
second Reflex save or be picked up bodily and held suspended in
the powerful winds, automatically taking the listed damage each
round. A creature that can fly is allowed a Reflex save each
round to escape the whirlwind. The creature still takes damage
but can leave if the save is successful. The DC for saves against
the whirlwind's effects varies with the elemental's size.
</p>
<p>The elemental can eject any carried creatures whenever it
wishes, depositing them wherever the whirlwind happens to be. A
summoned elemental always ejects trapped creatures before
returning to its home plane.
</p>
<p>If the whirlwind's base touches the ground, it creates a
swirling cloud of debris. This cloud is centered on the elemental
and has a diameter equal to half the whirlwind's height. The
cloud obscures all vision, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet.
Creatures 5 feet away have one-half concealment, while those
farther away have total concealment. Those caught in the cloud
must succeed at a Concentration check to cast a spell (DC equal
to the Reflex save DC).</p>

<SpecialAbilities>
<SpecialAbility Name="Elemental" Type="Ex">
<p>Elemental: Immune to poison, sleep, paralysis, and stunning.
Not subject to critical hits.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Water Mastery " Type="Ex">
<p>Water Mastery (Ex): A water elemental gains a +1 attack and
damage bonus if both it and its opponent touch water. If the
opponent or elemental is landbound, the elemental suffers a -4
penalty to attack and damage. (These modifiers are not included
in the statistics block.) A water elemental can be a serious
threat to a ship that crosses its path. The elemental can easily
overturn small craft (5 feet of length per Hit Die of the
elemental) and stop larger vessels (10 feet long per HD). Even
large ships (20 feet long per HD) can be slowed to half speed.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Drench " Type="Ex">
<p>Drench (Ex): The elemental's touch puts out torches,
campfires, exposed lanterns, and other open flames of nonmagical
origin if these are of Large size or smaller. The creature can
dispel magical fire it touches as dispel magic cast by a sorcerer
whose level equals the elemental's HD total.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Vortex " Type="Su">
<p>Vortex (Su): The elemental can transform itself into a
whirlpool once every 10 minutes, provided it is underwater, and
remain in that form for up to 1 round for every 2 HD it has. In
vortex form, the elemental can move through the water or along
the bottom at its swim speed.  The vortex is DC 13, damage 1d4,
and up to 20 feet high.
</p>
<p>The vortex is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 30 feet wide at
the top, and 10 feet or more tall, depending on the
elemental's size. The elemental controls the exact height,
but it must be at least 10 feet.
</p>
<p>Creatures one or more sizes smaller than the elemental might
take damage when caught in the vortex (see the table below for
details) and may be swept up by it. An affected creature must
succeed at a Reflex save when it comes into contact with the
vortex or take the listed damage. It must also succeed at a
second Reflex save or be picked up bodily and held suspended in
the powerful currents, automatically taking damage each round. A
creature that can swim is allowed a Reflex save each round to
escape the vortex. The creature still takes damage, but can leave
if the save is successful. The DC for saves against the
vortex's effects varies with the elemental's size.
</p>
<p>The elemental can eject any carried creatures whenever it
wishes, depositing them wherever the vortex happens to be. A
summoned elemental always ejects trapped creatures before
returning to its home plane.
</p>
<p>If the vortex's base touches the bottom, it creates a
swirling cloud of debris. This cloud is centered on the elemental
and has a diameter equal to half the vortex's height. The
cloud obscures all vision, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet.
Creatures 5 feet away have one-half concealment, while those
farther away have total concealment. Those caught in the cloud
must succeed at a Concentration check to cast a spell (DC equal
to the Reflex save DC).</p>

<p>A huge water elemental is 32 feet high and weighs
18,000 lbs.</p>

<p>Water elementals speak Aquan but rarely choose to do so.</p>
</General>
<SpecialAbilities>
<SpecialAbility Name="Elemental" Type="Ex">
<p>Elemental: Immune to poison, sleep, paralysis, and stunning.
Not subject to critical hits.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Water Mastery " Type="Ex">
<p>Water Mastery (Ex): A water elemental gains a +1 attack and
damage bonus if both it and its opponent touch water. If the
opponent or elemental is landbound, the elemental suffers a -4
penalty to attack and damage. (These modifiers are not included
in the statistics block.) A water elemental can be a serious
threat to a ship that crosses its path. The elemental can easily
overturn small craft (5 feet of length per Hit Die of the
elemental) and stop larger vessels (10 feet long per HD). Even
large ships (20 feet long per HD) can be slowed to half speed.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Drench " Type="Ex">
<p>Drench (Ex): The elemental's touch puts out torches,
campfires, exposed lanterns, and other open flames of nonmagical
origin if these are of Large size or smaller. The creature can
dispel magical fire it touches as dispel magic cast by a sorcerer
whose level equals the elemental's HD total.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Vortex " Type="Su">
<p>Vortex (Su): The elemental can transform itself into a
whirlpool once every 10 minutes, provided it is underwater, and
remain in that form for up to 1 round for every 2 HD it has. In
vortex form, the elemental can move through the water or along
the bottom at its swim speed.  The vortex is DC 25, damage 2d8,
and up to 50 feet high.
</p>
<p>The vortex is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 30 feet wide at
the top, and 10 feet or more tall, depending on the
elemental's size. The elemental controls the exact height,
but it must be at least 10 feet.
</p>
<p>Creatures one or more sizes smaller than the elemental might
take damage when caught in the vortex (see the table below for
details) and may be swept up by it. An affected creature must
succeed at a Reflex save when it comes into contact with the
vortex or take the listed damage. It must also succeed at a
second Reflex save or be picked up bodily and held suspended in
the powerful currents, automatically taking damage each round. A
creature that can swim is allowed a Reflex save each round to
escape the vortex. The creature still takes damage, but can leave
if the save is successful. The DC for saves against the
vortex's effects varies with the elemental's size.
</p>
<p>The elemental can eject any carried creatures whenever it
wishes, depositing them wherever the vortex happens to be. A
summoned elemental always ejects trapped creatures before
returning to its home plane.
</p>
<p>If the vortex's base touches the bottom, it creates a
swirling cloud of debris. This cloud is centered on the elemental
and has a diameter equal to half the vortex's height. The
cloud obscures all vision, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet.
Creatures 5 feet away have one-half concealment, while those
farther away have total concealment. Those caught in the cloud
must succeed at a Concentration check to cast a spell (DC equal
to the Reflex save DC).</p>

<p>Air Mastery (Ex): Airborne creatures suffer a -1 circumstance

<SpecialAbility Name="Whirlwind " Type="Su">
<p>Whirlwind (Su): The djinni can transform itself into a
whirlwind once every 10 minutes and remain in that form for up to
7 rounds. In this form, it can move through the air or along a
surface at its fly speed. The whirlwind is 5 feet wide at the
base, up to 30 feet wide at the top and up to 50 feet tall. The
djinni controls the exact height, but it must be at least 10
feet. Medium-size or smaller creatures might take damage when
caught in the whirlwind and be lifted into the air. An affected
creature must succeed at a Reflex save (DC 20) when it comes into
contact with the whirlwind or take 3d6 points of damage. It must
also succeed at a second Reflex save or be picked up bodily and
held suspended in the powerful winds, automatically taking 1d8
points of damage each round. A creature that can fly is allowed a
Reflex save (DC 20) each round to escape the whirlwind. The
creature still takes damage but can leave if the save is
successful. The djinni can eject any carried creatures whenever
it wishes, depositing them wherever the whirlwind happens to be.
</p>
<p>If the whirlwind's base touches the ground, it creates a
swirling cloud of debris. This cloud is centered on the djinni
and has a diameter equal to half the whirlwind's height. The
cloud obscures all vision, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet.
Creatures 5 feet away have one-half concealment, while those
farther away have total concealment. Those caught in the cloud
must succeed at a Concentration check (DC 20) to cast a spell.</p>

<p>Stench (Ex): The stink of death and corruption surrounding

that time averts the transformation. (The statistics above are

<p>A golem's creator can command it if the golem is within
60 feet and can see and hear its creator. If uncommanded, the
golem usually follows its last instruction to the best of its
ability, though if attacked it returns the attack. The creator
can give the golem a simple program to govern its actions in his
or her absence.</p>

<p>Golems do not need to breathe and are immune to most forms of
energy.</p>
</General>
<SpecialAbilities>
<SpecialAbility Name="Construct" Type="Ex">
<p>Construct: Immune to mind-influencing effects, poison,
disease, and similar effects. Not subject to critical hits,
subdual damage, ability damage, energy drain, or death from
massive damage.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Berserk " Type="Ex">
<p>Berserk (Ex): When a flesh golem enters combat, there is a
cumulative 1% chance each round that its elemental spirit breaks
free and goes berserk. The uncontrolled golem goes on a rampage,
attacking the nearest living creature or smashing some object
smaller than itself if no creature is within reach, then moving
on to spread more destruction. The golem's creator, if
within 60 feet, can try to regain control by speaking firmly and
persuasively to the golem, which requires a successful Charisma
check (DC 19). It takes 1 minute of rest by the golem to reset
the golem's berserk chance to 0%.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Magic Immunity " Type="Ex">
<p>Magic Immunity (Ex): Flesh golems are immune to all spells,
spell-like abilities, and supernatural effects, except as
follows. Fire- and cold-based effects slow them (as the spell)
for 2d6 rounds, with no saving throw. An electricity effect
breaks any slow effect on the golem and cures 1 point of damage
for each 3 points of damage it would otherwise deal. For example,
a flesh golem hit by a lightning bolt cast by a 5th-level wizard
gains back 6 hit points if the damage total is 18. The golem
rolls no saving throw against electricity effects.</p>
</SpecialAbility>
</SpecialAbilities>
<Construction>
<p>The cost listed for each golem includes that of the physical
body and all the materials and spell components that are consumed
or become a permanent part of it.</p>

<p>Understanding the rituals requires a character of the required
level with the Craft Magic Arms and Armor and Craft Wondrous Item
feats. The creator must labor for at least 8 hours each day in a
specially prepared laboratory or workroom. The chamber is similar
to an alchemist's laboratory and costs 500 gp to establish.</p>

<p>When not working on the rituals, the creator must rest and can
perform no other activities except eating, sleeping, or talking.
If personally constructing the golem's body, the creator can
perform the building and rituals together. If the creator misses
a day of rituals, the process fails and must be started again.
Money spent is lost, but XP spent are not. The golem's body
can be reused, as can the laboratory.</p>

<p>Completing the ritual drains the appropriate XP from the
creator and requires casting any spells on the final day. The
creator must cast the spells personally, but they can come from
outside sources, such as scrolls. </p>

<p>The flesh golem costs 50,000 gp to create, which includes 500 gp
for the construction of the body. Assembling the body requires a
successful Craft (leatherworking) or Heal check (DC 13). The
creator must be 14th level and able to cast arcane spells.
Completing the ritual drains 1,000 XP from the creator and
requires bull's strength, geas/quest, limited wish,
polymorph any object, and protection from arrows.</p>

deals 3d12 points of damage to it. A disintegrate spell slows the
golem (as the slow spell) for 1d6 rounds and deals 1d12 points of

<SpecialAbility Name="Haste " Type="Su">

<p>The clay golem costs 60,000 gp to create, including 1,500 gp

Creating the body requires a successful Craft (sculpting or

<Description>
<General>
<p>A golem's creator can command it if the golem is within
60 feet and can see and hear its creator. If uncommanded, the
golem usually follows its last instruction to the best of its
ability, though if attacked it returns the attack. The creator
can give the golem a simple program to govern its actions in his
or her absence.</p>

<p>Golems do not need to breathe and are immune to most forms of
energy.</p>
</General>
<SpecialAbilities>
<SpecialAbility Name="Construct" Type="Ex">
<p>Construct: Immune to mind-influencing effects, poison,
disease, and similar effects. Not subject to critical hits,
subdual damage, ability damage, energy drain, or death from
massive damage.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Slow " Type="Su">
<p>Slow (Su): A stone golem can use slow as a free action once
every 2 rounds. The effect has a range of 10 feet and a duration
of 7 rounds, requiring a successful Will save (DC 13) to negate.
The ability is otherwise the same as the spell.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Magic Immunity " Type="Ex">
<p>Magic Immunity (Ex): A stone golem is immune to all spells,
spell-like abilities, and supernatural effects, except as
follows. A transmute rock to mud spell slows it (as the slow
spell) for 2d6 rounds, with no saving throw, while transmute mud
to rock heals all of its lost hit points. A stone to flesh spell
does not actually change the golem's structure but makes it
vulnerable to any normal attack for the following round (this
does not include spells, except those that cause damage).</p>
</SpecialAbility>
</SpecialAbilities>
<Construction>
<p>The cost listed for each golem includes that of the physical
body and all the materials and spell components that are consumed
or become a permanent part of it.</p>

<p>Understanding the rituals requires a character of the required
level with the Craft Magic Arms and Armor and Craft Wondrous Item
feats. The creator must labor for at least 8 hours each day in a
specially prepared laboratory or workroom. The chamber is similar
to an alchemist's laboratory and costs 500 gp to establish.</p>

<p>When not working on the rituals, the creator must rest and can
perform no other activities except eating, sleeping, or talking.
If personally constructing the golem's body, the creator can
perform the building and rituals together. If the creator misses
a day of rituals, the process fails and must be started again.
Money spent is lost, but XP spent are not. The golem's body
can be reused, as can the laboratory.</p>

<p>Completing the ritual drains the appropriate XP from the
creator and requires casting any spells on the final day. The
creator must cast the spells personally, but they can come from
outside sources, such as scrolls. </p>

<p>The stone golem costs 80,000 gp to create, which includes 1,000 gp
for the body. Assembling the body requires a successful Craft
(sculpting or masonry) check (DC 17). The creator must be 16th
level and able to cast arcane spells. Completing the ritual
drains 1,600 XP from the creator and requires geas/quest, limited
wish, polymorph any object, and slow.</p>

damage death.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Magic Immunity " Type="Ex">
<p>Magic Immunity (Ex): An iron golem is immune to all spells,
spell-like abilities, and supernatural effects, except as
follows. An electricity effect slows it (as the slow spell) for 3
rounds, with no saving throw. A fire effect breaks any slow
effect on the golem and cures 1 point of damage for each 3 points
of damage it would otherwise deal. For example, a flesh golem hit
by a fireball cast by a 5th-level wizard gains back 6 hit points
if the damage total is 18. The golem rolls no saving throw
against fire effects.</p>

<SpecialAbility Name="Evil Eye " Type="Su">
<p>Evil Eye (Su): Three times per day a sea hag can cast its dire
gaze upon any single creature within 30 feet. The target must
succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 11). Creatures who fail have a
25% chance of dying instantly from fright; even if they survive,
they fall into a whimpering catatonia for three days, although
remove curse or dispel evil can restore sanity sooner.</p>

<SpecialAbilities>
<SpecialAbility Name="Deep Halfling Traits " Type="Ex">
<p>Deep Halfling Traits (Ex):  Deep halflings benefit from a
number of racial traits.
<ul>
<li>Small: Halflings gain a +1 size bonus to AC and attack
rolls and a +4 size bonus to Hide checks, but they must
use smaller weapons than humans use, and their lifting
and carrying limits are three-quarters of those of
Medium-size creatures.</li>
<li>+1 racial bonus to all saving throws.</li>
<li>+2 morale bonus to saving throws against fear. (This
bonus stacks with the halfling's +1 bonus to saving
throws in general.)</li>
<li>+1 racial attack bonus with a thrown weapon.</li>
<li>Darkvision up to 60 feet.</li>
<li>Stonecunning: Like dwarves, deep halflings receive a +2
racial bonus to checks to notice unusual stonework.
Something that isn't stone but that is disguised as
stone also counts as unusual stonework. A deep halfling
who merely comes within 10 feet of unusual stonework can
make a check as though actively searching and can use the
Search skill to find stonework traps as a rogue can. A
deep halfling can also intuit depth, sensing the
approximate distance underground as naturally as a human
can sense which way is up.</li>
</ul>
</p>
</SpecialAbility>
</SpecialAbilities>
<Skills>
<p>Skills: Deep halflings receive a +2 racial bonus to Appraise
checks and Craft checks that are related to stone or metal.  Their
keen hearing bestows a +2 racial bonus to Listen checks. </p>

<Characters>
<p>A deep halfling's favored class is rogue.</p>

<p>Hydras can attack with all their heads at no penalty, even if
they move or charge during the round.</p>

<p>A hydra can be killed either by severing all its heads or by
slaying its body. To sever a head, an opponent must hit the
monster's neck with a slashing weapon and deal damage equal
to the hydra's original hit point total, divided by its
original number of heads, in one blow. (The player says where the
attack is aimed just before making the attack roll.) For example,
if a five-headed hydra has 52 hp, a single blow dealing 10 or
more points of damage severs a head (52 / 5 = 10.4, rounded down
to 10). Any excess damage is lost. A severed head dies, and a
natural reflex seals the neck shut to prevent further blood loss.
The hydra can no longer attack with the severed head but suffers
no other penalties. A severed head regrows in about a month.</p>

<p>These reddish hydras can breathe jets of fire 10 feet high, 10
feet wide, and 20 feet long. All heads breathe once every 1d4
rounds. Each jet deals 3d6 damage per head. A successful Reflex
save halves the damage. The save DC is 10 + 1/2 hydra's
original number of heads + the hydra's Constitution
modifier.</p>

<p>Hydras can attack with all their heads at no penalty, even if
they move or charge during the round.</p>

<p>A hydra can be killed either by severing all its heads or by
slaying its body. To sever a head, an opponent must hit the
monster's neck with a slashing weapon and deal damage equal
to the hydra's original hit point total, divided by its
original number of heads, in one blow. (The player says where the
attack is aimed just before making the attack roll.) For example,
if a five-headed hydra has 52 hp, a single blow dealing 10 or

<p>These reddish hydras can breathe jets of fire 10 feet high, 10
feet wide, and 20 feet long. All heads breathe once every 1d4
rounds. Each jet deals 3d6 damage per head. A successful Reflex
save halves the damage. The save DC is 10 + 1/2 hydra's
original number of heads + the hydra's Constitution
modifier.</p>

<p>Hydras can attack with all their heads at no penalty, even if
they move or charge during the round.</p>

<p>A hydra can be killed either by severing all its heads or by
slaying its body. To sever a head, an opponent must hit the
monster's neck with a slashing weapon and deal damage equal
to the hydra's original hit point total, divided by its
original number of heads, in one blow. (The player says where the
attack is aimed just before making the attack roll.) For example,
if a five-headed hydra has 52 hp, a single blow dealing 10 or
more points of damage severs a head (52 / 5 = 10.4, rounded down
to 10). Any excess damage is lost. A severed head dies, and a
natural reflex seals the neck shut to prevent further blood loss.

<p>These purplish hydras can breathe jets of frost 10 feet high,
10 feet wide, and 20 feet long. All heads breathe once every 1d4
rounds. Each jet deals 3d6 damage per head. A successful Reflex
save halves the damage. The save DC is 10 + 1/2 hydra's
original number of heads + the hydra's Constitution
modifier.</p>

<p>Hydras can attack with all their heads at no penalty, even if
they move or charge during the round.</p>

<p>A hydra can be killed either by severing all its heads or by
slaying its body. To sever a head, an opponent must hit the
monster's neck with a slashing weapon and deal damage equal
to the hydra's original hit point total, divided by its
original number of heads, in one blow. (The player says where the
attack is aimed just before making the attack roll.) For example,
if a five-headed hydra has 52 hp, a single blow dealing 10 or
more points of damage severs a head (52 / 5 = 10.4, rounded down
to 10). Any excess damage is lost. A severed head dies, and a
natural reflex seals the neck shut to prevent further blood loss.
The hydra can no longer attack with the severed head but suffers
no other penalties. A severed head regrows in about a month.</p>

<Combat>
<p>Hydras can attack with all their heads at no penalty, even if
they move or charge during the round.</p>

<p>A hydra can be killed either by severing all its heads or
by slaying its body. To sever a head, an opponent must hit the
monster's neck with a slashing weapon and deal damage equal
to the hydra's original hit point total, divided by its
original number of heads, in one blow. (The player says where the
attack is aimed just before making the attack roll.) For example,
if a five-headed hydra has 52 hp, a single blow dealing 10 or
more points of damage severs a head (52 / 5 = 10.4, rounded down
to 10). Any excess damage is lost. A severed head dies, and a
natural reflex seals the neck shut to prevent further blood loss.
The hydra can no longer attack with the severed head but suffers
no other penalties.</p>

<p>The only way to slay a Lernaean hydra normally is to sever
all its heads. However, each time a head is severed, two new heads
spring from the stump in 1d4 rounds. A Lernaean hydra can never
have more than twice its original number of heads at any one
time, and any extra heads it gains beyond its original number
wither and die within a day.</p>

<p>To prevent a severed head from growing back into two, at
least 5 points of fire or acid damage must be dealt to the stump (AC
19) before the new heads appear.</p>

<p>Spells such as disintegrate, finger of death, and slay living
kill a Lernaean hydra outright if they succeed. If the spell
deals damage on a successful save, that damage is directed
against one of the hydra's heads.</p>

<p>Hydras can attack with all their heads at no penalty, even if
they move or charge during the round.</p>

<p>A hydra can be killed either by severing all its heads or
by slaying its body. To sever a head, an opponent must hit the
monster's neck with a slashing weapon and deal damage equal
to the hydra's original hit point total, divided by its
original number of heads, in one blow. (The player says where the
attack is aimed just before making the attack roll.) For example,
if a five-headed hydra has 52 hp, a single blow dealing 10 or
more points of damage severs a head (52 / 5 = 10.4, rounded down
to 10). Any excess damage is lost. A severed head dies, and a
natural reflex seals the neck shut to prevent further blood loss.
The hydra can no longer attack with the severed head but suffers
no other penalties.</p>

<p>The only way to slay a Lernaean hydra normally is to sever
all its heads. However, each time a head is severed, two new heads
spring from the stump in 1d4 rounds. A Lernaean hydra can never
have more than twice its original number of heads at any one
time, and any extra heads it gains beyond its original number
wither and die within a day.</p>

<p>To prevent a severed head from growing back into two, at
least 5 points of fire or acid damage must be dealt to the stump (AC
19) before the new heads appear.</p>

<p>Spells such as disintegrate, finger of death, and slay living
kill a Lernaean hydra outright if they succeed. If the spell
deals damage on a successful save, that damage is directed
against one of the hydra's heads.</p>

<p>These reddish hydras can breathe jets of fire 10 feet high, 10
feet wide, and 20 feet long. All heads breathe once every 1d4
rounds. Each jet deals 3d6 damage per head. A successful Reflex
save halves the damage. The save DC is 10 + 1/2 hydra's
original number of heads + the hydra's Constitution
modifier.</p>

<p>Hydras can attack with all their heads at no penalty, even if
they move or charge during the round.</p>

<p>A hydra can be killed either by severing all its heads or by
slaying its body. To sever a head, an opponent must hit the
monster's neck with a slashing weapon and deal damage equal
to the hydra's original hit point total, divided by its
original number of heads, in one blow. (The player says where the
attack is aimed just before making the attack roll.) For example,
if a five-headed hydra has 52 hp, a single blow dealing 10 or
more points of damage severs a head (52 / 5 = 10.4, rounded down
to 10). Any excess damage is lost. A severed head dies, and a
natural reflex seals the neck shut to prevent further blood loss.

<p>The only way to slay a Lernaean hydra normally is to sever all
its heads. However, each time a head is severed, two new heads
spring from the stump in 1d4 rounds. A Lernaean hydra can never
have more than twice its original number of heads at any one
time, and any extra heads it gains beyond its original number
wither and die within a day.</p>

<p>To prevent a severed head from growing back into two, at least
5 points of fire or acid damage must be dealt to the stump (AC
19) before the new heads appear.</p>

<p>Spells such as disintegrate, finger of death, and slay living
kill a Lernaean hydra outright if they succeed. If the spell
deals damage on a successful save, that damage is directed
against one of the hydra's heads.</p>

<p>These reddish hydras can breathe jets of fire 10 feet high, 10
feet wide, and 20 feet long. All heads breathe once every 1d4
rounds. Each jet deals 3d6 damage per head. A successful Reflex
save halves the damage. The save DC is 10 + 1/2 hydra's
original number of heads + the hydra's Constitution
modifier.</p>

<p>Hydras can attack with all their heads at no penalty, even if
they move or charge during the round.</p>

<p>A hydra can be killed either by severing all its heads or by
slaying its body. To sever a head, an opponent must hit the
monster's neck with a slashing weapon and deal damage equal
to the hydra's original hit point total, divided by its
original number of heads, in one blow. (The player says where the
attack is aimed just before making the attack roll.) For example,
if a five-headed hydra has 52 hp, a single blow dealing 10 or
more points of damage severs a head (52 / 5 = 10.4, rounded down
to 10). Any excess damage is lost. A severed head dies, and a
natural reflex seals the neck shut to prevent further blood loss.

<p>These reddish hydras can breathe jets of fire 10 feet high, 10
feet wide, and 20 feet long. All heads breathe once every 1d4
rounds. Each jet deals 3d6 damage per head. A successful Reflex
save halves the damage. The save DC is 10 + 1/2 hydra's
original number of heads + the hydra's Constitution
modifier.</p>

<p>Hydras can attack with all their heads at no penalty, even if
they move or charge during the round.</p>

<p>A hydra can be killed either by severing all its heads or by
slaying its body. To sever a head, an opponent must hit the
monster's neck with a slashing weapon and deal damage equal
to the hydra's original hit point total, divided by its
original number of heads, in one blow. (The player says where the
attack is aimed just before making the attack roll.) For example,
if a five-headed hydra has 52 hp, a single blow dealing 10 or
more points of damage severs a head (52 / 5 = 10.4, rounded down
to 10). Any excess damage is lost. A severed head dies, and a
natural reflex seals the neck shut to prevent further blood loss.
The hydra can no longer attack with the severed head but suffers
no other penalties. </p>

<p>The only way to slay a Lernaean hydra normally is to sever all
its heads. However, each time a head is severed, two new heads
spring from the stump in 1d4 rounds. A Lernaean hydra can never
have more than twice its original number of heads at any one
time, and any extra heads it gains beyond its original number
wither and die within a day.</p>

<p>To prevent a severed head from growing back into two, at least
5 points of fire or acid damage must be dealt to the stump (AC
19) before the new heads appear.</p>

<p>Spells such as disintegrate, finger of death, and slay living
kill a Lernaean hydra outright if they succeed. If the spell
deals damage on a successful save, that damage is directed
against one of the hydra's heads.</p>

<Combat>
<p>These purplish hydras can breathe jets of frost 10 feet high,
10 feet wide, and 20 feet long. All heads breathe once every 1d4
rounds. Each jet deals 3d6 damage per head. A successful Reflex
save halves the damage. The save DC is 10 + 1/2 hydra's
original number of heads + the hydra's Constitution
modifier.</p>

<p>Hydras can attack with all their heads at no penalty, even if
they move or charge during the round.</p>

<p>A hydra can be killed either by severing all its heads or by
slaying its body. To sever a head, an opponent must hit the
monster's neck with a slashing weapon and deal damage equal
to the hydra's original hit point total, divided by its
original number of heads, in one blow. (The player says where the
attack is aimed just before making the attack roll.) For example,
if a five-headed hydra has 52 hp, a single blow dealing 10 or
more points of damage severs a head (52 / 5 = 10.4, rounded down
to 10). Any excess damage is lost. A severed head dies, and a
natural reflex seals the neck shut to prevent further blood loss.
The hydra can no longer attack with the severed head but suffers
no other penalties. </p>

<p>The only way to slay a Lernaean hydra normally is to sever all
its heads. However, each time a head is severed, two new heads
spring from the stump in 1d4 rounds. A Lernaean hydra can never
have more than twice its original number of heads at any one
time, and any extra heads it gains beyond its original number
wither and die within a day.</p>

<p>To prevent a severed head from growing back into two, at least
5 points of fire or acid damage must be dealt to the stump (AC
19) before the new heads appear.</p>

<p>Spells such as disintegrate, finger of death, and slay living
kill a Lernaean hydra outright if they succeed. If the spell
deals damage on a successful save, that damage is directed
against one of the hydra's heads.</p>

<SpecialAbility Name="Breath Weapon " Type="Su">
<p>Breath Weapon (Su): Cone of magma, 10 feet, every 1d4 rounds
as a standard action; damage 1d4, Reflex half DC 12. Living creatures
that fail their saves are tormented by burned skin and seared eyes
unless they are immune to or protected from fire. This imposes a -4
morale penalty to AC and a -2 morale penalty to attack rolls for 3
rounds.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Spell-Like Abilities" Type="Ex">
<p>Spell-Like Abilities: Once per hour, a magma mephit can
shapechange into a pool of lava 3 feet in diameter and 6 inches
deep. The mephit's damage reduction improves to 20/+1. The
mephit can't attack while in lava form but can use other
spell-like abilities. It can move at a speed of 10 feet, but it
can't "run." In this form the mephit can pass
through small holes or narrow openings, even mere cracks. The
pool's touch ignites flammable materials such as paper,
straw, or dry wood.
</p>
<p>Once per day a magma mephit can use pyrotechnics as the spell
cast by a 6th-level sorcerer (save DC 12 + spell level). It can use
itself as the fire source without harm.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Summon Mephit " Type="Sp">
<p>Summon Mephit (Sp): Once per day, all mephits can summon other
mephits much as though casting a summon monster spell, but they
have only a 25% chance of success to summon one mephit of the
same type. Roll d%: On a failure, no creature answers the
summons. A mephit that has just been summoned cannot use its own
summon ability for 1 hour.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Fire Subtype " Type="Ex">
<p>Fire Subtype (Ex): Fire immunity, double damage from cold
except on a successful save.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Fast Healing " Type="Ex">
<p>Fast Healing (Ex): A magma mephit heals 2 points of damage
each round, provided it is still alive and it is touching magma,
lava, or a flame at least as large as a torch.</p>

<SpecialAbility Name="Undead" Type="Ex">
<p>Undead: Immune to mind-influencing effects, poison, sleep,
paralysis, stunning, and disease. Not subject to critical hits,
subdual damage, ability damage, energy drain, or death from
massive damage.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Chill Aura " Type="Su">
<p>Chill Aura (Su): All nightshades radiate a 60-foot-radius aura
of utter cold. While this aura does not damage living things, it
spoils any food and drink it touches. In addition, it ruins holy
water and magic potions, oils, and ointments unless the items
succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 22). Items that successfully save
cannot be affected again by the same nightshade's aura for
one day. This bone-numbing cold is so distinctive that anyone
exposed to it once instantly recognizes it in the future, so it
is difficult for a nightshade to surprise someone who has
previously encountered such a beast.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Spell-Like Abilities" Type="Ex">
<p>Spell-Like Abilities: At will-cause disease, charm person,
cloudkill, confusion, darkness, dispel magic, haste, hold person,
and invisibility; once per night: finger of death. These
abilities are as the spells cast by a sorcerer whose level equals
the nightshade's HD total (save DC 14 + spell level).</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Summon Undead " Type="Su">
<p>Summon Undead (Su): A nightshade can summon undead creatures
once every 4 hours: 2-5 shadows, 1-2 wraiths, 1 spectre, or 1
ghost. The undead arrive in 1d10 rounds and serve for 1 hour or
until released.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Aversion to Daylight " Type="Ex">
<p>Aversion to Daylight (Ex): Nightshades are creatures of utter
darkness. While they loathe all light, if exposed to natural
daylight (not merely a daylight spell), they suffer a -4 morale
penalty to all attack rolls.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Cold Immunity " Type="Ex">
<p>Cold Immunity (Ex): Nightshades suffer no damage from cold.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Spell Immunity " Type="Su">
<p>Spell Immunity (Su): Nightshades ignore the effects of spells
and spell-like abilities of 6th level or lower, just as if the
spellcaster had failed to overcome spell resistance.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Detect Magic " Type="Su">
<p>Detect Magic (Su): A nightshade can continuously detect magic
as the spell cast by a 20th-level sorcerer. It can suppress or
resume this ability as a free action.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="See Invisibility " Type="Su">
<p>See Invisibility (Su): A nightshade can continuously see
invisibility as the spell cast by a 20th-level sorcerer. It can
suppress or resume this ability as a free action.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Telepathy " Type="Su">
<p>Telepathy (Su): Nightshades can communicate telepathically
with any creature within 100 feet that has a language.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Damage Reduction " Type="Su">
<p>Damage Reduction (Su): All nightshades have damage reduction
25/+3.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Magic Drain " Type="Su">
<p>Magic Drain (Su): A nightwing can weaken magic armor,
weapons, and shields by making a successful touch attack. The
target item must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 20) or lose one
"plus" (for example, a +2 sword becomes a +1 sword). An
item that is completely drained becomes normal in all respects
and loses any other powers (such as flame tongue) as well.
Casting dispel evil upon the item reverses the effects of the
magic drain, provided this occurs within a number of days after
the attack equal to the caster's level.</p>

nightcrawler's gizzard, and is subject to the
creature's energy drain. A swallowed creature can climb out
of the gizzard with a successful grapple check. This returns it
to the nightcrawler's maw, where another successful grapple
check is needed to get free. A swallowed creature can also cut
its way out by using claws or a Small or Tiny slashing weapon to
deal 35 points of damage to the gizzard (AC 24). Once the
creature exits, muscular action closes the hole; another
swallowed opponent must cut its own way out. The

<p>Engulf (Ex): Although it moves slowly, a gelatinous cube can
simply mow down Large or smaller creatures as a standard action.
It cannot make a slam attack during a round in which it engulfs.
The gelatinous cube merely has to move over the opponents,
affecting as many as it can cover. Opponents can make opportunity
attacks against the cube, but if they do so they are not entitled
to a saving throw. Those who do not attempt opportunity attacks
must succeed at a Reflex save (DC 13) or be engulfed; on a
success, they are pushed back or aside (opponent's choice)
as the cube moves forward. Engulfed creatures are subject to the
cube's paralysis and acid, and are considered to be grappled
and trapped within its body.</p>

<SpecialAbilities>
<SpecialAbility Name="Pounce " Type="Ex">
<p>Pounce (Ex): If a red slaad leaps upon a foe during the first
round of combat, it can make a full attack even if it has already
taken a move action.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Implant " Type="Ex">
<p>Implant (Ex): A red slaad that hits with a claw attack can
inject an egg pellet into the opponent's body. The affected
creature must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 17) to avoid
implantation. Often the slaad implants an unconscious or
otherwise helpless creature (which gets no saving throw). The egg
gestates for one week before hatching into a blue slaad that eats
its way out, killing the host. Twenty-four hours before the egg
fully matures, the victim falls extremely ill (-10 to all ability
scores). A remove disease spell rids a victim of the pellet, as
does a successful Heal check (DC 20) by someone with that skill.
If the check fails, the healer can try again, but each attempt
(successful or not) deals 1d4 points of damage to the patient. If
the host is an arcane spellcaster, the egg pellet instead hatches
into a green slaad.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Stunning Croak " Type="Su">
<p>Stunning Croak (Su): Once per day a red slaad can emit a loud
croak. Every creature within 20 feet must succeed at a Fortitude
save (DC 16) or be stunned for 1d3 rounds.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Summon Slaad " Type="Sp">
<p>Summon Slaad (Sp): Once per day a red slaad can attempt to
summon another red slaad with a 40% chance of success.  This is much as
though casting a summon monster spell. Summoned creatures automatically
return whence they came after 1 hour. A slaad that has just been
summoned cannot use its own summon ability for 1 hour. </p>

</p>
<p>Once per day three blue slaadi working together can produce
chaos hammer (save DC 16) as the spell cast by a 15th-level
sorcerer.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Disease " Type="Ex">
<p>Disease (Ex): The bite of a blue slaad can cause a terrible
transformation. Affected creatures must succeed at a Fortitude
save (DC 17) or be infected with a disease that transforms the
victim over the next week into a red slaad. The infected creature
can attempt a new save each day to throw off the infection. If
the infected being is an arcane spellcaster, the disease instead
produces a green slaad.</p>

<SpecialAbility Name="Roar " Type="Su">
<p>Roar (Su): Three times per day an androsphinx can loose a
mighty roar. The first time it does this, all creatures within
500 feet must succeed at a Will save (DC 19) or be affected as
though by a fear spell for 12 rounds. If the sphinx roars a
second time during the same encounter, all creatures within 250
feet must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 19) or be paralyzed for
1d4 rounds, and all those within 90 feet are deafened for 2d6
rounds (no save). If it roars a third time during the same
encounter, all those within 250 feet must succeed at a Fortitude
save (DC 19) or take 2d4 points of temporary Strength damage for
2d4 rounds. In addition, any Medium-size or smaller creature
within 90 feet must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 19) or be
thrown to the ground and take 2d8 points of damage. The force of
this roar is so great that it deals 50 points of damage to any
stone or crystalline object within 90 feet. Magic items and held
or carried items can avoid damage with a successful Reflex save
(DC 19). Other androsphinxes are immune to these effects.</p>

<SpecialAbilities>
<SpecialAbility Name="Spell-Like Abilities" Type="Ex">
<p>Spell-Like Abilities: 1/day-animal trance, cause fear,
deeper darkness, entangle, neutralize poison, suggestion, and
polymorph other. These abilities are as the spells cast by an
8th-level sorcerer (save DC 13 + spell level).</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Psionics " Type="Sp">
<p>Psionics (Sp): All yuan-ti can produce the following effects
at will:
<ul>
<li>Detect Poison: As the spell cast by a 6th-level sorcerer.</li>
<li>Alternate Form: The yuan-ti can assume the form of a Tiny
to Large viper. This ability is similar to a shapchange
spell cast by a 19th-level sorcerer but allows only viper
forms. If the yuan-ti has a poisonous bite of its own, it
uses its own or the viper's poison, whichever is
more potent.</li>
<li>Chameleon Power: The yuan-ti can change the coloration of
itself and its equipment to match its surroundings.</li>
<li>Produce Acid: The yuan-ti can exude acid from its body,
dealing 1d6 points of damage to anything it touches. The
acid becomes inert when it leaves the yuan-ti's
body.</li>
<li>Aversion: The yuan-ti creates a compulsion effect
targeting one creature within 30 feet. The subject must
succeed at a Will save (DC 17) or gain an aversion to
snakes for 10 minutes. Affected subjects must stay at
least 20 feet from any snake or yuan-ti, alive or dead;
if already within 20 feet, they move away. A subject can
overcome the compulsion by succeeding at another DC 17
Will save, but still suffers deep anxiety. This causes a
-4 reduction to Dexterity until the effect wears off or
the subject is no longer within 20 feet of a snake or
yuan-ti. This ability is otherwise similar to antipathy
as cast by a 16th-level sorcerer.</li>

<SpecialAbility Name="Improved Grab " Type="Ex">
<p>Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a snake-headed
abomination must hit with its bite attack. If it gets a hold, it
can constrict.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Constrict " Type="Ex">
<p>Constrict (Ex): An abomination deals 1d6+6 points of damage
with a successful grapple check (using the bite attack bonus if
snake-headed) against Large or smaller creatures.</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Spell-Like Abilities" Type="Ex">
<p>Spell-Like Abilities: (Human-headed) 1/day-animal trance,
cause fear, deeper darkness, entangle, neutralize poison,
suggestion, and polymorph other. These abilities are as the
spells cast by an 8th-level sorcerer (save DC 13 + spell level).</p>
</SpecialAbility>

<SpecialAbility Name="Psionics " Type="Sp">
<p>Psionics (Sp): All yuan-ti can produce the following effects
at will:
<ul>
<li>Detect Poison: As the spell cast by a 6th-level sorcerer.</li>
<li>Alternate Form: The yuan-ti can assume the form of a Tiny
to Large viper. This ability is similar to a shapchange
spell cast by a 19th-level sorcerer but allows only viper
forms. If the yuan-ti has a poisonous bite of its own, it
uses its own or the viper's poison, whichever is
more potent.</li>
<li>Chameleon Power: The yuan-ti can change the coloration of
itself and its equipment to match its surroundings.</li>
<li>Produce Acid: The yuan-ti can exude acid from its body,
dealing 1d6 points of damage to anything it touches. The
acid becomes inert when it leaves the yuan-ti's
body.</li>
<li>Aversion: The yuan-ti creates a compulsion effect
targeting one creature within 30 feet. The subject must
succeed at a Will save (DC 17) or gain an aversion to
snakes for 10 minutes. Affected subjects must stay at
least 20 feet from any snake or yuan-ti, alive or dead;
if already within 20 feet, they move away. A subject can
overcome the compulsion by succeeding at another DC 17
Will save, but still suffers deep anxiety. This causes a
-4 reduction to Dexterity until the effect wears off or
the subject is no longer within 20 feet of a snake or
yuan-ti. This ability is otherwise similar to antipathy
as cast by a 16th-level sorcerer.</li>
</ul>

<p>Poison (Ex): Halfbloods and abominations with snake heads
only-bite, Fortitude save (DC 17); initial and secondary damage
